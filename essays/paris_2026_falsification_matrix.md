# Paris 2026 Municipal Election: Falsification Matrix
## Testing the Weakened Noose Hypothesis Against Observable Data

---

## Core Claims from Electoral Topology Theory

### Claim 1: Reform Breaks the Compression Mechanism
**Hypothesis:** "Reducing the majority bonus from 50% to 25% and allocating 75% of seats proportionally transforms the Noose into a Rope, allowing multi-polar stability instead of binary collapse"

### Claim 2: Centrist Viability Persists
**Hypothesis:** "Under weakened Noose conditions, centrist candidates (Bournazel) should remain viable (>12%) through first round, unlike Full Noose systems where they terminal at 8-10%"

### Claim 3: Low Compression Velocity
**Hypothesis:** "Paris should show compression velocity <1.5 points/week vs. Colombia's 5.6 points/week, demonstrating that electoral mathematics drives compression, not campaign dynamics"

### Claim 4: Multi-Polar Second Round
**Hypothesis:** "Multiple runoff scenarios remain competitive (margins <5 points), proving the system hasn't forced binary convergence"

### Claim 5: Coalition Governance
**Hypothesis:** "Winner requires 3+ party coalition to reach 82-seat majority, demonstrating that reduced majority bonus prevents hegemonic control"

## Falsification Schedule: Critical Dates & Thresholds

### DATE 1: February 7, 2026 (5 Weeks Before First Round)
**Event Context:** Mid-campaign snapshot, post-holiday political reactivation

**Data Required:** Major polling firms (Ifop, Elabe, Ipsos, Cluster17)

| Metric | Weakened Noose Prediction | Full Noose Counterfactual | Falsification Threshold | Interpretation if Threshold Met |
|--------|---------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Lists Polling >10%** | 4-5 lists remain viable | Collapse to 2-3 lists | Only 2 lists >10% | Reform failed; binary compression active |
| **Bournazel Support** | Stable 13-17% | Drops below 10% | <11% | Centrist strangulation occurring despite reform |
| **Compression Velocity** | <1.5 points/week since Jan 9 | >3 points/week | >2.5 points/week | Topology unchanged; Noose reasserting |
| **Grégoire Ceiling** | 32-37% (needs coalition) | >42% (approaching majority) | >40% | Left consolidating hegemonically |
| **Dati Support** | 24-28% (stable right pole) | >35% (absorbing center-right) | >32% | Right consolidating at center's expense |
| **Second Round Margins** | Multiple matchups within 5 points | All scenarios >8 point spreads | All polls show >10 point margins | Binary dynamics emerging |

**Critical Test:** If Bournazel drops below 11% AND only 2 lists remain above 10%, the Noose is active despite the 25% bonus reform.

---

### DATE 2: February 28, 2026 (2 Weeks Before First Round)
**Event Context:** Final campaign stretch; last debate cycle

**Data Required:** Final polling wave, voter certainty metrics, runoff scenarios

| Metric | Weakened Noose Prediction | Full Noose Counterfactual | Falsification Threshold | Interpretation if Threshold Met |
|--------|---------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Lists Polling >8%** | 5-6 lists competitive | 3 lists maximum | Only 3 lists >8% | Late compression; Noose tightening |
| **Bournazel Trajectory** | Stable or slight growth (14-18%) | Hemorrhaging to poles | Drops to <10% | Centrist voters forced into binary choice |
| **Voter Certainty (Bournazel supporters)** | >60% "definitely voting for" | <45% certain (considering tactical voting) | <50% certain | Voters perceiving wasted vote; Noose psychology active |
| **Knafo + Mariani (Far-right) Combined** | 12-16% (fragmented) | >20% (consolidated) | >22% | Far-right consolidating despite multi-candidate field |
| **Chikirou Support** | 10-13% (stable far-left) | <8% (absorbed by Grégoire) | <7% | Left completing bipolar consolidation |
| **Grégoire vs Dati Second Round** | Within 3 points either way | >6 point spread | >8 point spread | Binary equilibrium forming |

**Critical Test:** If Bournazel drops below 10% AND voter certainty among his supporters falls below 50%, tactical voting psychology indicates Noose still active.

---

### DATE 3: March 8, 2026 (1 Week Before First Round)
**Event Context:** Final polls before electoral silence; psychological compression window

**Data Required:** Last published polls, campaign closing statements, voter mobility data

| Metric | Weakened Noose Prediction | Full Noose Counterfactual | Falsification Threshold | Interpretation if Threshold Met |
|--------|---------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Lists Polling >10%** | 4-5 lists | 2 lists | 2-3 lists only | Terminal compression achieved |
| **Bournazel Floor** | Holds 12-16% | Collapses to <8% | <10% | Centrist space extracted |
| **Compression Velocity (Feb 28-Mar 8)** | <1 point/week | >4 points/week | >3 points/week | Late surge compression (Full Noose signature) |
| **Undecided/Unsure %** | 15-20% remaining | <8% remaining | <10% | Binary pressure forcing resolution |
| **Runoff Scenarios Tested** | 3+ competitive pairings | Only Grégoire vs Dati matters | Only 1 runoff scenario polled | Pollsters recognize binary convergence |
| **Geographic Polarization (Arrondissement-level)** | Diverse support across districts | Strong left/right geographic sorting | Gini coefficient >.45 | Spatial polarization indicates forced alignment |

**Critical Test:** If compression velocity exceeds 3 points/week in this final week AND undecided drops below 10%, the system is exhibiting Full Noose terminal compression despite the reform.

---

### DATE 4: March 15, 2026 (First Round Results)
**Event Context:** Actual votes cast; test whether polling captured dynamics

**Data Required:** Official results from Mairie de Paris, turnout data, arrondissement breakdowns

| Metric | Weakened Noose Prediction | Full Noose Counterfactual | Falsification Threshold | Interpretation if Threshold Met |
|--------|---------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Lists Receiving >10% of Votes** | 4-5 lists | 2-3 lists maximum | Only 3 lists >10% | Reform failed; actual voting showed binary pressure |
| **Bournazel First Round %** | 13-17% | <9% | <11% | Centrist vote collapsed on election day |
| **Top Two Margin** | 4-10 points separation | <3 points (hypercompression) | <2 points | Bipolar convergence achieved |
| **Third Place Distance from Second** | Within 6-8 points | >12 points (clear cut-off) | >10 points | "Wasted vote" cliff detected |
| **Voter Turnout** | 45-52% | >58% (polarization mobilizes) | >55% | High stakes binary choice drives turnout |
| **Geographic Clustering (Gini)** | <.38 (diverse) | >.48 (polarized) | >.42 | Spatial sorting indicates forced binary alignment |
| **Polling Error Magnitude** | ±2-3 points standard | >6 points systematic error | >5 points error | Late hidden movement; polls missed compression |

**Critical Test:** If Bournazel finishes <11% AND only 3 lists exceed 10% AND geographic Gini >.42, the Noose remained active through voting day despite reform.

---

### DATE 5: March 22, 2026 (Second Round Results)
**Event Context:** Coalition formation test; governance viability

**Data Required:** Final results, eliminated candidates' endorsements, seat allocation by list

| Metric | Weakened Noose Prediction | Full Noose Counterfactual | Falsification Threshold | Interpretation if Threshold Met |
|--------|---------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Winner's Total Seat Count** | 55-70 seats (needs coalition) | >75 seats (near-majority alone) | >73 seats | Majority bonus still too strong; reform insufficient |
| **Number of Lists Winning Seats** | 5-7 lists represented | 3-4 lists only | 4 or fewer lists | Binary pressure suppressed minor parties |
| **Winner's First-Round Voters as % of Second-Round Total** | 70-80% | >90% (pure binary alignment) | >85% | Second round was pure binary consolidation |
| **Winning Margin** | 50-53% | >55% or <48% (unstable) | >54% | Either hegemonic victory or hypercompression |
| **Bournazel Voter Behavior (if eliminated)** | Split 55-45% between poles | >70% to one candidate | >75% to one pole | Centrist voters had clear binary preference |
| **Coalition Size Required** | 3+ parties for majority | 1-2 parties sufficient | Winner + 1 party reaches 82 seats | Majority bonus still enables hegemony |
| **Post-Election Stability** | Complex coalition negotiations | Clear majority formed immediately | Majority announced within 48 hours | System still produces dominant winner |

**Critical Test:** If winner gets >73 seats alone OR only 4 lists win seats OR winning coalition is 2 parties or fewer, the 25% bonus is still functioning as a Noose.

## Compound Falsification Conditions

### STRONG FALSIFICATION (Reform Failed; Noose Still Active)
**Requires THREE OR MORE of the following:**

1. Bournazel finishes first round with <11% (centrist strangulation)
2. Only 3 lists receive >10% in first round (binary compression)
3. Compression velocity exceeds 2.5 points/week in final month (rapid convergence)
4. Winner obtains >73 seats alone (majority bonus still dominant)
5. Geographic Gini coefficient >.42 (spatial polarization)
6. Only 4 or fewer lists win council seats (effective suppression)

**Interpretation:** The two-round structure itself creates sufficient Noose pressure that reducing the majority bonus from 50% to 25% is insufficient. The Noose operates through psychological compression (wasted vote fear) not just mechanical seat allocation.

---

### PARTIAL FALSIFICATION (Reform Partially Successful; Hybrid System)
**Requires TWO of the following:**

1. Bournazel finishes 11-13% (centrist weakened but not strangled)
2. 4 lists receive >10% in first round (moderate compression)
3. Winner receives 68-73 seats (requiring small coalition)
4. 5 lists win seats (moderate diversity)
5. Compression velocity 1.8-2.5 points/week (moderate dynamics)

**Interpretation:** The reform shifted the system from Full Noose → Weakened Noose, but didn't fully convert to Rope. Multi-polar stability exists but with residual binary pressure.

---

### STRONG CONFIRMATION (Reform Succeeded; Noose Broken)
**Requires ALL of the following:**

1. Bournazel finishes first round with >13% (centrist viability maintained)
2. 5+ lists receive >10% in first round (multi-polar stability)
3. Compression velocity remains <1.5 points/week throughout (no rapid collapse)
4. Winner obtains <68 seats alone (forced coalition building)
5. 6+ lists win council seats (genuine diversity)
6. Winning coalition requires 3+ parties (no hegemony)
7. Geographic Gini coefficient <.38 (diverse support)
8. Bournazel voters split <70% to either pole in second round (no forced binary)

**Interpretation:** The 25% majority bonus successfully broke the compression mechanism. Electoral mathematics no longer forces binary convergence. The system functions as a Rope (coordination) rather than Noose (extraction).

## Comparative Metrics: Paris 2026 vs. Colombia 2026

### Direct Topology Comparison

| Dimension | Paris 2026 (Weakened Noose) | Colombia 2026 (Full Noose) | Expected Ratio |
|-----------|----------------------------|---------------------------|----------------|
| **Compression Velocity** | <1.5 points/week | 5.6 points/week | 3.7x slower |
| **Centrist Terminal %** | 13-17% | 9.4% | 1.5x higher |
| **Lists >10% at T-30 days** | 4-5 | 2-3 | 2x more |
| **Winner Seat % (of total)** | 34-43% (55-70 of 163) | ~35-40% first round | Similar (but Paris needs coalition) |
| **Geographic Polarization** | <.38 | >.45 | Less polarized |
| **Voter Certainty (final week)** | >60% | >82% | Lower (more flexibility) |

**Key Prediction:** If Paris shows compression velocity >2.5 points/week, it indicates the two-round structure is sufficient to create Noose dynamics regardless of majority bonus size.

## Data Collection Protocol

### Required Data Sources (Monitor These):

1. **Polling firms:** Ifop, Elabe, Ipsos, Cluster17, OpinionWay
2. **Official results:** Mairie de Paris / Préfecture de Paris
3. **Runoff scenarios:** Track all possible second-round matchups weekly
4. **Voter certainty:** "Definitely voting for X" vs. "Might change mind" metrics
5. **Geographic data:** Arrondissement-level results for Gini calculation
6. **Endorsement patterns:** Which eliminated candidates support whom in second round

### Key Variables to Track Weekly (Feb 1 - Mar 15):

- Grégoire %
- Dati %
- Bournazel % ← **CRITICAL INDICATOR**
- Chikirou %
- Mariani %
- Knafo %
- Lists polling >10% (count)
- Lists polling >8% (count)
- Undecided %
- Voter certainty % (by candidate)
- Second round scenario margins (all pairings)
- Compression velocity (week-over-week change)

### Geographic Indicators (After March 15):

- Arrondissement-level vote shares for each list
- Calculate Gini coefficient for spatial concentration
- Map center-left/center-right vs. far-left/far-right geographic clustering
- Identify if wealthy western arrondissements vs. working-class eastern arrondissements show binary sorting

---

## Using This Matrix

### Flag System:
- 🟢 **Green Flag (Reform Working):** Data consistently meets Weakened Noose predictions
- 🟡 **Yellow Flag (Hybrid System):** Data shows partial compression; reform incomplete
- 🔴 **Red Flag (Reform Failed):** Data meets Full Noose counterfactual thresholds

### Track Cumulative Red Flags:
- **0-1 Red Flags:** Reform robust; Noose broken
- **2-3 Red Flags:** Reform partial; system is hybrid Weakened Noose
- **4+ Red Flags:** Reform failed; Full Noose dynamics persist

---

## Calibration Against Colombia 2026

**The Parallel Test:** Both elections occur within 11 weeks of each other:
- Paris First Round: March 15, 2026
- Colombia First Round: May 31, 2026

This allows **real-time comparison** of two systems with different constraint topologies:

### If Paris shows compression <2 points/week AND Colombia shows >4 points/week:
→ **Strong evidence** that majority bonus size determines compression velocity

### If both Paris and Colombia show >4 points/week compression:
→ **Evidence** that two-round structure itself creates Noose regardless of majority bonus

### If Paris shows <2 points/week but Colombia shows <3 points/week:
→ **Evidence** that cultural/campaign factors dominate over topology

**This parallel natural experiment is the core test of the Electoral Topology Hypothesis.**

---

## Meta-Analysis: What This Proves

### If Paris Reform Succeeds:
- Electoral mathematics is **causal** for compression dynamics
- Interventions (reducing majority bonus) can **break Noose → Rope**
- The constraint topology framework has **predictive power**

### If Paris Reform Fails:
- Two-round structure is **sufficient** for Noose compression
- Psychological effects (wasted vote fear) dominate mechanical effects
- Reform must address **electoral system fundamentals**, not just magnitude of bonus

### If Results Are Ambiguous:
- Need to refine model to distinguish **mechanical vs. psychological** compression
- May require voter survey data on tactical voting motivations
- Geographic and demographic variables may interact with topology in complex ways

**Alternative Scenario (30% confidence):**
- Paris shows compression velocity 2.2-3.5 points/week (Partial reform)
- Bournazel finishes 10-12% (weakened centrist)
- 4 lists exceed 10% in first round
- Winner requires 2-party coalition
- **Verdict: Reform partial; two-round structure still creates moderate Noose**

**Null Hypothesis (10% confidence):**
- Paris shows compression velocity >4 points/week (Reform failed)
- Bournazel finishes <10% (centrist strangled)
- 3 lists exceed 10% in first round
- Winner achieves near-majority alone
- **Verdict: Reform failed; two-round structure is sufficient for Full Noose dynamics**

---

**The advantage of this matrix:** It forces specific, dated, quantitative predictions that can't be retrofitted. The Paris election will definitively test whether electoral topology is determinative or merely correlative.
