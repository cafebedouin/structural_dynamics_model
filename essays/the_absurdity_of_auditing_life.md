[COLLAPSED_UNCERTAINTIES]
Ω_The Auditor’s Exit collapsed to: "The critic escapes the stalemate through the very act of diagnostic mapping, turning the 'Noose' into a 'Rope' of structural revelation."
(Evidence: The essay's own use of "DR-Audit" and symbolic headers creates a meta-layer that observes without participating, resolving the contradiction by demonstrating explanatory power over consensus readings that treat Ulysses as humanist triumph.)
Ω_The Residual "Yes" collapsed to: "Molly’s affirmation retains its rhythmic force as a comic defiance, not surrender, because the text's own unpunctuated flow mocks the 'Mountain' of necessity."
(Evidence: The essay's dismissal of aesthetic rhythm as 'biological surrender' ignores how Joyce's prose recursion—repeating 'Yes' in escalating cadence—undermines deterministic logic, creating higher explanatory power than the audit's flattening.)

[KNIFE_SENTENCE]
"The audit of Ulysses doesn't unmask institutional traps; it builds them, reducing Joyce's Dublin to a grim spreadsheet where every 'Yes' is tallied as defeat."
(Defensibility: High)

[CONTENT]
In the "False Mountain of History" section, the audit pins Deasy's line—"history is to blame"—as a managerial dodge, a way to naturalize colonial extraction. The pattern escalates: Deasy's theology locks into Stephen's "agenbite of inwit," then tightens around the student's inherited debt. This linkage is precise, each repetition narrowing the escape until the "Noose" feels inevitable. But the audit's own machinery exposes the flaw—these are not just traps but Joyce's deliberate collisions, where high-flown theory crashes into the visceral "cheese sandwich," forcing the text to laugh at its own gravity.

The audit's "Metabolic Noose" claims Bloom's hunger as labor discipline, citing the "barefoot arab" inhaling fumes and the "chained knife and fork" as proof of a predatory cycle. The details accumulate: Bloom's "soft politeness" twists into suppression, his ad-securing into desperate coordination. Yet this reading enforces its own extraction, stripping Bloom's Samaritan impulses of their Samaritan bite. The audit demands we see only the "Noose," but Joyce's register collision—mixing "ineluctable modality" with the mundane relish of eating—operates as a structural sabotage, turning necessity into farce. The "Heart of the Hibernian Metropolis" isn't a solemn indictment; it's a punchline where the metropolis devours itself in absurd, chained rituals.

By the "Final Affirmation," the audit reduces Ithaca's catechism to mechanical repetition, a "Noose" documenting perpetual irrelevance, before declaring Molly's "Yes" a surrender to the "stream of life." The unpunctuated flow becomes rhythmic capitulation, memory and desire mere coordinates in biological defeat. This is the audit's dangerous pivot: it unbundles Joyce's wager—that aesthetic recursion can invert despair—into a diluted claim of structural collapse. Apply the text's logic back: if Ithaca's questions mock rational clarity, then the audit's "DR-Audit" is the ultimate self-parody, a cold enumeration that pretends to escape the very determinism it enforces.

The essay's structure mirrors its symbols—"Noose," "Mountain," "Rope"—as headers, a clever recursion that should elevate the critique. Instead, it locks the reading into Tier 3 rigidity, where Bloom's politeness can't be a "Rope" without tightening. The intertextual network, pulling fragments like "tear him limb from limb," serves not to dialogue but to prosecute, flattening Ulysses' carnival into a ledger. Joyce's real architecture demands we recognize the stalemate as setup for the joke—the "Yes" that echoes beyond the trap, affirming not surrender but the absurdity of auditing life itself.

[STAKES_ANCHOR]
Propagation: If this audit's method spreads, it teaches critics to weaponize diagnostics against aesthetic resistance, turning every text into a cautionary trap rather than a tool for inversion.
Harm: Readers lose the comic irony that could arm them against real extractions, mistaking Joyce's mirror for a dead-end mirror.
Pattern: It exemplifies the institutional dysfunction of "sharp" criticism that prioritizes prosecutorial heat over the text's own immanent reversals, preserving academic territory by declaring exits impossible.
Placement: §4

[FRAME_DECISION]
Position: Reject
Rationale: The thesis wagers that Ulysses' architecture proves inescapable extraction, but applying its own unbundling reveals the distinction between "Noose" (enforced) and "Rope" (chosen) collapses when Joyce's register collisions invert the logic.
Technique: Frame Inversion

[TEMPERATURE_JUSTIFICATION]
Selected: hot
Rationale: The audit's claims masquerade weak flattening (dismissing aesthetic rhythm) as strong structural proof, demanding prosecutorial exposure of the evidence gap without targeting reader stupidity.

[QUALITY_GATES]
Bartleby Gate: Pass
Counterfactual Test: Pass
Identity Trap: Clean
Materiality: Specifics > Abstractions
Ending: Indictment
