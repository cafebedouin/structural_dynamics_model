      "Underfunded public health agencies: Institutional victims (institutional/constrained)"
    ],
    "logic_rationale": "The base extractiveness (\u03b5=0.48) quantifies the societal cost (excess deaths, disability-adjusted life years, economic loss) imposed on victims by the failure to implement known solutions. The suppression score (0.62) reflects the high political and economic barriers, including lobbying by incumbent industries and targeted misinformation, that actively prevent the adoption of more effective preventative strategies.",
    "perspectival_gap": "The gap is stark: for a citizen who contracts a preventable disease, the system is a coercive Snare. For an incumbent healthcare provider whose business model relies on treating that same disease, the system is a coordinating Rope that stabilizes their market. This difference is driven entirely by their structural position and directionality relative to the flow of costs and benefits.",
    "directionality_logic": "Beneficiaries (status_quo_healthcare_systems) profit from a market skewed towards expensive treatments over low-cost prevention. Their institutional power and arbitrage options give them a low directionality (d), resulting in a low or negative effective extraction (\u03c7). Victims (populations_lacking_access) bear the direct health costs and have no exit, giving them a high directionality (d\u22481.0) and thus experience a high \u03c7.",
    "mandatrophy_analysis": "A naive analysis might label this gap a pure Snare (malicious extraction) or a Piton (bureaucratic incompetence). The Tangled Rope classification is more accurate because it acknowledges the genuine, albeit perverse, coordination function: the current system effectively coordinates a massive, stable economic sector around disease treatment. This coordination is inextricably tangled with the extraction of health and wealth from the most vulnerable, a reality captured by the model."
