Timeline:       0 to 10
Structural Pattern: stable
Confidence:     high

[CONSTRAINT INVENTORY: REALITY AUDIT]
  Constraint | Claimed | Actual | Action
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  mandatrophic_margin_collapse | noose | noose | cut

[META-LOGICAL AUDIT: ONTOLOGICAL FRAUD DETECTION]
  No classification errors detected. System is Ontologically Coherent.

[STRUCTURAL SIGNATURE ANALYSIS]
  mandatrophic_margin_collapse: constructed_constraint (confidence: medium)
    → CONSTRUCTED CONSTRAINT signature for mandatrophic_margin_collapse: Active enforcement detected (suppression=0.70, resistance=0.50) with 0 asymmetric beneficiaries. This is an institutionally maintained rule requiring ongoing suppression energy.

[PERSPECTIVAL GAP ANALYSIS]

  Analysis for Constraint: mandatrophic_margin_collapse
    ! ALERT: Extractive "Noose" is masked as a functional "Rope" in the Institutional view.
    ! BLINDNESS: Institutions may not see the extraction they benefit from.
    - Individual (Powerless): noose
    - Institutional (Manager): rope

[OMEGA GENERATION FROM PERSPECTIVAL GAPS]
  Generated 1 Omega variables from perspectival gaps:

  Ω: omega_extraction_blindness_mandatrophic_margin_collapse (conceptual)
     Question: Constraint mandatrophic_margin_collapse appears extractive (Noose) to individuals but functional (Rope) to institutions. Is this: (a) institutions unaware of extraction, (b) institutions benefiting and obscuring, or (c) different legitimate framings? Policy authority depends on answer.
