  │  Institutions see: ROPE (optional, changeable)
  │
  │  RESOLUTION STRATEGY:
  │  1. SAFETY ASSESSMENT (DO NOT SKIP):
  │     - If institutions cut ulysses_hades_1904, do individuals have alternatives?
  │     - Is this their only survival mechanism?
  │     - What scaffolding exists for transition?
  │  2. Test institutional perception:
  │     - Can institutions unilaterally change this?
  │     - Do they understand downstream impacts?
  │     - Is their "optional" view empirically accurate?
  │  3. Decision tree:
  │     IF truly unchangeable → Correct institutional view to MOUNTAIN
  │     IF changeable + safe alternatives → Correct powerless view to ROPE
  │     IF changeable + NO alternatives → ADD SCAFFOLD before any change
  │     IF uncertainty → HALT changes until resolved

  │     - What legal/political mechanisms exist?
  │     - Historical precedents of change?
  │  2. Test extraction:
  │     - Is benefit flow symmetric or asymmetric?
  │     - Who has veto power over changes?
  │  3. Decision tree:
  │     IF truly unchangeable + extractive → MANDATROPHY
  │     IF changeable + extractive → Correct to SNARE
  │     IF unchangeable + fair → Correct to MOUNTAIN
