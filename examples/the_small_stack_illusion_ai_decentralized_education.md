## The Small Stack Illusion: How AI Decentralizes Education While Tightening Its Grip

AI decentralizes the delivery unit while centralizing the dependency structure. Microschools operate as franchises of infrastructure they cannot replicate.

The pattern looks like liberation. Student AI usage jumped from 66% in 2024 to 92% in 2025, and between 750,000 and 2.1 million students now attend microschools across the United States. Small learning pods replace factory-model classrooms. Parents launch schools in living rooms. The industrial era's "bigness" fractures into personalized pathways. AI tutors lower coordination costs enough that a certified teacher no longer gates instruction—a microschool founder with cloud credits and curriculum APIs can assemble what used to require a building full of administrators.

The Colorado State Board of Education sees the threat. Their regulatory structure treats age-grading, standardized testing, and teacher licensure as non-negotiable quality signals. Most microschools operate under homeschool laws (55%) or as private schools (37%) precisely because compliance requirements designed for thousand-student districts consume the entire operational budget of a fifteen-student pod. The Board isn't defending education—it's defending institutional legitimacy as the sole pathway to credentials employers recognize. The friction is structural: regulations built for coordination at scale become extractive when applied to small units that exist specifically to escape that scale.

But the Board misidentifies the real constraint. The microschool isn't escaping centralization—it's swapping one form for another.

Every AI-powered pod sits on infrastructure it cannot own. The small learning community sources its adaptive curriculum from a platform. The platform runs on cloud compute it rents by the hour. The compute trains on datasets assembled by entities operating at Google-scale efficiency. Institutions shifted from compliance-based to mission-based AI adoption in 2025, but "mission" still means selecting from pre-built vendor stacks. The pod controls pedagogy. The platform controls pricing, data access, and the algorithms determining what "personalized learning" means in practice.

This is the trick: AI doesn't decentralize power—it decentralizes the visible unit while concentrating dependency. The microschool founder operates with genuine autonomy over curriculum and instruction. But she cannot train her own language model. She cannot negotiate platform terms from a position where exit is cheap. When the infrastructure provider adjusts pricing or deprecates an API, every pod using that stack adjusts or dies. The factory model kept students trapped in buildings. The platform model keeps operators trapped in ecosystems.

The substrate data reveals the structural signature. Base extractiveness scores 0.5—moderate—because value flows both ways: the platform genuinely enables coordination the pod couldn't achieve alone, but it also captures surplus through lock-in mechanisms the pod cannot escape. Suppression scores 0.4 because alternatives remain visible, just expensive to access. The system requires active enforcement not through regulatory mandate but through network effects and switching costs. This is a constructed constraint masquerading as technological necessity.

By late 2026, using generative AI for everything will become taboo among students, one expert predicts. Peer accountability will enforce meaningful effort over cognitive offloading. But that cultural correction addresses student dependency, not institutional dependency. The microschool still depends on the same platforms whether students use AI for every assignment or none. The dependency runs deeper than usage patterns—it's embedded in the cost structure that made small-scale operation viable in the first place.

The implementation roadmap imagines solving this through open standards and verifiable digital credentials. Phase one: protocol selection. Phase two: unbundling pilot. Phase three: market validation. The goal is killing the credential legitimacy omega—making micro-achievements as portable and valuable as bundled degrees. The substrate classifies this roadmap as "rope" from the architect's perspective: a functional tool for coordination, modular and beneficial when adopted.

But who enforces interoperability when platform capture offers higher returns than open ecosystems? West Virginia became one of the few states to define a microschool in 2022, establishing legal recognition distinct from private schools or homeschools. That's regulatory clarity, not infrastructure independence. The pods still rent their AI capabilities from the same vendors whether the state calls them microschools or learning pods. Open standards require sustained enforcement against the natural economic incentive toward proprietary lock-in. The roadmap assumes institutional commitment to openness. The platform business model assumes the opposite.

The Colorado Board operates from institutional power, seeing regulations as quality guarantees. The microschool founder operates from individual power, seeing the same regulations as extractive barriers. Both perspectives miss that AI shifts the constraint location without eliminating it. The factory model trapped students in buildings and standardized curricula. The platform model traps operators in dependency relationships where the infrastructure provider sets terms unilaterally. The student escapes the building. The operator escapes district bureaucracy. Neither escapes extraction.

Some universities restrict or ban AI tools in coursework due to cheating concerns, while others partner with AI developers to roll out customized tools. The divergent responses reflect confusion about what AI changes structurally versus what it automates procedurally. Banning ChatGPT doesn't address platform dependency—it just prevents students from accessing tools the institution itself relies on for administrative efficiency. Embracing AI without addressing ownership and interoperability doesn't empower educators—it converts them into integration specialists for vendor roadmaps they didn't author.

The pattern repeats across education levels. Standalone humanities majors like English and history decline by 3-5% annually while interdisciplinary programs that embed technical skills grow. The shift isn't toward depth—it's toward stackability, assembling credentials that signal competencies employers recognize. But stackability assumes portability, and portability requires standards no single platform has incentive to honor. The credential market fragments into proprietary ecosystems where achievements don't transfer cleanly across institutional boundaries. This is unbundling in name, re-bundling in practice.

The substrate marks two omegas as irreducible without additional data: whether employers will treat alternative credentials as meaningful signals, and whether open standards can prevent total platform capture. Both remain unresolved because resolution requires coordination the current system structurally discourages. Employers adopt credentials that reduce hiring risk. Platforms adopt standards that don't threaten market position. The microschool movement grows by escaping factory-model regulations, not by solving the dependency problem those regulations were designed—however poorly—to address.

The extractiveness isn't malicious. Platforms genuinely lower barriers to entry. Cloud infrastructure genuinely costs less than owning hardware. AI tutors genuinely enable personalization that human-only instruction couldn't scale. The problem is structural: lowering coordination costs for small units doesn't eliminate coordination costs—it shifts who bears them and who captures the surplus. The microschool founder gains pedagogical freedom. The platform operator gains pricing power and data access. One dependency relationship replaces another.

The test is exit. The factory-model student couldn't leave without forfeiting credentials. The microschool operator can switch platforms—in theory. In practice, migration costs rise with adoption depth. Curriculum integrations, parent training, student data, institutional knowledge about platform quirks—all become switching costs. The platform that enables small-scale operation also makes small-scale exit expensive. That's not a bug in AI-powered decentralization. That's the core mechanism.

The roadmap to unbundling assumes stakeholders will choose interoperability over capture when given the choice. History suggests they won't. 85% of microschool leaders report being far less likely to participate if required to follow state-approved curricula. They're defending autonomy against state mandates while building on platform mandates they didn't negotiate. The irony isn't hypocrisy—it's misidentification of the binding constraint. State boards are visible and local. Platform dependencies are distributed and abstracted behind APIs. One feels like bureaucracy. The other feels like infrastructure.

The pattern will harden in 2026. The policies, tools, and norms districts choose now will set defaults for how a generation learns. But "choosing" implies agency the substrate data undermines. Districts choose from vendor menus. Vendors optimize for platform stickiness, not customer sovereignty. The default isn't chosen—it emerges from accumulated switching costs and network effects that make the first platform you deeply integrate the last platform you can afford to leave.

This is how AI decentralizes education: by making small units viable while ensuring they remain dependent. The delivery layer fragments. The infrastructure layer consolidates. Students escape the factory. Operators rent the factory's replacement from landlords who own the only buildings in town. The bottleneck isn't regulatory friction or credential legitimacy. It's the assumption that lowering coordination costs eliminates power asymmetries rather than relocating them.

The Colorado State Board will lose this fight. Microschools will continue growing because families want personalization and AI makes small-scale operation economically feasible. But the Board's defeat won't produce the decentralization the movement imagines. It will produce a system where the delivery unit is small and the dependency structure is total. The student will learn in a pod of fifteen. The pod will operate on infrastructure it cannot replicate or escape. That's not liberation from the factory model. That's franchising it.
