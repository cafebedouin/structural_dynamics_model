# The Piton Effect: When Coordination Becomes Extraction

The global order hasn't collapsed because it stopped working—it collapsed the moment it started working exclusively for those who manage it.

Rome fell in a day, but not because the walls suddenly weakened. The sack of 410 AD was simply the moment when accumulated rot became visible. The diagnosis for contemporary hegemonic decline follows an identical pattern, but with one critical difference: our institutional walls still stand. They perform stability while the foundation crumbles. This is not coordination failure—it is coordination captured.

The evidence is structural, not speculative. Wealth concentration accelerates through Cantillon effects: those nearest the money spigot benefit first and most from monetary expansion. Tax havens convert national obligations into optional philanthropy for the mobile class. Frictionless shipping decouples production from proximity, allowing capital to extract value from labor markets without contributing to their maintenance. These are not policy errors. They are the system achieving its actual function.

The divergence appears in the measurements. From 2016 to 2026, the theater ratio—the gap between institutional performance and actual coordination—climbed from 0.35 to 0.78. Simultaneously, extraction accumulated from 0.30 to 0.72. This is metric substitution drift: the constraint shifted from providing coordination to performing coordination while extracting surplus. The theater ratio crossing 0.70 triggers a classification change from functional rope to inertial piton—a constraint that persists not because it works but because removing it requires energy no one can organize.

But the classification depends entirely on who you ask. For institutional actors with global mobility and access to capital flows, the constraint registers as rope: chi = -0.14, a net benefit. The system coordinates their interests effectively. Frictionless shipping works. Tax havens work. Dollar hegemony works. For the powerless—the fragmented middle class trapped in national jurisdictions—the same constraint registers as snare: chi = 1.08, capped at the maximum extractive burden. The perspectival gap measures 1.14, exceeding the critical threshold for mandatrophy: the system extracts more than it coordinates, yet persists.

This is the Piton Effect. The global order continues because the institutional class mistakes their local benefit for systemic function. They experience coordination. They see a rope. The diagnostic classification as "constructed constraint" confirms this: active enforcement detected (suppression=0.10, resistance=0.50) with zero asymmetric beneficiaries acknowledged. The system requires ongoing suppression energy to maintain what looks like natural equilibrium.

The resistance isn't populism in the pejorative sense—it's the structural consequence of asymmetric burden distribution. When wealth was distributed broadly, everyone had skin in the game. Maintenance was rational self-interest. But profits accrued upward, creating a coordination problem: those with the power to maintain the system have less incentive to do so, while those with the incentive lack the power. Political fragmentation isn't irrational backlash. It's the equilibrium response to extraction disguised as coordination.

The omega variable the system generates asks whether this is reversible policy error or civilizational mountain. The substrate collapses this uncertainty: it's neither. It's a constructed constraint that has achieved its terminal state. The theater ratio and extraction score have both plateaued at their respective ceilings. There is no policy lever to pull because the policies are working as designed. The question isn't whether the system can be reformed—it's whether the institutional class can perceive that what they experience as functional coordination is experienced by the majority as predatory extraction.

The technological stagnation follows necessarily. Innovation requires shared infrastructure, distributed purchasing power, and social trust. Extraction cannibalizes all three. King Dollar is under siege not from external competitors but from internal hollowing. The global order fragments because there is no "global" left—only institutional actors optimizing within their mobility class and national populations experiencing abandonment.

The cost isn't one hegemon replacing another. It's the normalization of extraction as coordination. The dangerous precedent isn't American decline—it's the institutional class learning they can harvest a system's benefits while externalizing its maintenance costs indefinitely, as long as the theater holds. Rome fell in a day. We're watching the decade-long performance that precedes the gates opening.

[STAKES_ANCHOR]
Propagation: If institutional actors continue mistaking local benefit for systemic function, the pattern spreads: every coordination mechanism becomes an extraction opportunity dressed in stability theater. The piton effect becomes the default mode of institutional operation.
Harm: The fragmented middle class suffers terminal loss of social mobility and political agency while the system reports normal operation. The perspectival gap ensures their experience never registers in institutional metrics.
Pattern: This exemplifies the core dysfunction of contemporary governance—the complete decoupling of measurement from experience, where institutional dashboards show green while the substrate burns.

[QUALITY_GATES]
Simplicity Gate: Pass - Substrate shows clear pattern (theater ratio escalation + extraction accumulation), essay does not invent complexity
Counterfactual Test: Pass - Claims would be false if: (a) theater ratio remained stable <0.50, (b) perspectival gap showed symmetric burden, (c) extraction and coordination moved together rather than inversely
Substrate Fidelity: Pass - All major claims trace directly to diagnostic output measurements
Materiality: Pass - Concrete numbers (0.78 theater ratio, 1.14 perspectival gap, -0.14 vs 1.08 chi values) ground abstract claims
Stakes: Specific/Consequential - Identifies systemic pattern (extraction as coordination) with measurable harm (chi differential) and propagation mechanism (institutional measurement blindness)
Ending: Indictment - Final sentence frames the slow-motion collapse as performance, not accident
