Apply prompt and template and create a scenario that will pass the linter of the following text:

It is more difficult and time consuming to create and build, than it is to destroy or to rot from within. Rome may not have been built in a day, but it was sacked and looted on August 24th, 410 AD. The concentration of wealth, due to Cantillon effects, tax havens, and frictionless shipping, has created a situation where there is no political will to maintain the global order. When wealth was well distributed, and the middle class was flourishing, everyone had an incentive to maintain the system; but the profits have all accrued to the top, fomenting political populism. The internal politics of the USA will affect global politics, and a destructive feedback loop has ensued. The global order is fragmenting. Technological development is stagnating. King Dollar is under siege.
