[PERSPECTIVAL GAP ANALYSIS]

  Analysis for Constraint: hegemonic_entropy_2026
    ! ALERT: Extractive "Snare" is masked as functional "Rope".
    - Individual (Powerless): snare  [chi = 0.72 x 1.50 = 1.08 -> capped 1.00]
    - Institutional (Manager): rope  [chi = 0.72 x -0.20 = -0.14 -> net benefit]

  │
  │  CRITICAL: Extraction Masking Detected

  │  Institutions see: ROPE (functional rule)
  │
  │  RESOLUTION STRATEGY:
  │  1. Interview affected individuals (N=10+):
  │     - Who benefits from hegemonic_entropy_2026?
  │     - Can you change/exit this constraint?
  │     - What would happen if you tried?
  │  2. Interview institutional actors (N=10+):
  │     - What function does hegemonic_entropy_2026 serve?
  │     - Who would object to removing it?
  │     - What alternatives exist?
  │  3. Document benefit flows:
  │     - Track who gains vs. who loses from status quo
  │     - Measure asymmetric benefit distribution
  │  4. Decision tree:
  │     IF extraction confirmed → Reclassify as SNARE
  │     IF functional & fair → Reclassify as ROPE
