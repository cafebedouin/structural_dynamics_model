[META-LOGICAL AUDIT: ONTOLOGICAL FRAUD DETECTION]
  No classification errors detected. System is Ontologically Coherent.

[STRUCTURAL SIGNATURE ANALYSIS]
  molly_affirmation_cycle: constructed_constraint (confidence: low)
    → CONSTRUCTED CONSTRAINT signature for molly_affirmation_cycle: Active enforcement detected (suppression=0.50, resistance=0.50) with 0 asymmetric beneficiaries. This is an institutionally maintained rule requiring ongoing suppression energy.

[PERSPECTIVAL GAP ANALYSIS]

  Analysis for Constraint: molly_affirmation_cycle
    ! STALEMATE: Institutions believe constraint is unchangeable while individuals experience extraction.
    - Individual (Powerless): noose
    - Institutional (Manager): mountain

[OMEGA GENERATION FROM PERSPECTIVAL GAPS]
  Generated 1 Omega variables from perspectival gaps:

  Ω: omega_learned_helplessness_molly_affirmation_cycle (conceptual)
     Question: Constraint molly_affirmation_cycle appears extractive (Noose) to individuals but unchangeable (Mountain) to institutions. Is this: (a) institutions falsely claiming necessity to preserve extraction, (b) institutions genuinely unable to change despite unfairness, or (c) individuals misidentifying coordination as extraction? Resolution strategy depends on which.
