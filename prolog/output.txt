  Analysis for Constraint: dark_patterns_manipulation
    ! ALERT: Extractive "Noose" is masked as a functional "Rope" in the Institutional view.
    ! BLINDNESS: Institutions may not see the extraction they benefit from.
    - Individual (Powerless): noose
    - Institutional (Manager): rope

[OMEGA GENERATION FROM PERSPECTIVAL GAPS]
  Generated 1 Omega variables from perspectival gaps:

  Ω: omega_extraction_blindness_dark_patterns_manipulation (conceptual)
     Question: Constraint dark_patterns_manipulation appears extractive (Noose) to individuals but functional (Rope) to institutions. Is this: (a) institutions unaware of extraction, (b) institutions benefiting and obscuring, or (c) different legitimate framings? Policy authority depends on answer.

    ! ALERT: Extractive "Noose" is masked as a functional "Rope" in the Institutional view.
    ! BLINDNESS: Institutions may not see the extraction they benefit from.
    - Individual (Powerless): noose
    - Institutional (Manager): rope

  Ω: omega_extraction_blindness_traveling_salesperson_problem (conceptual)
     Question: Constraint traveling_salesperson_problem appears extractive (Noose) to individuals but functional (Rope) to institutions. Is this: (a) institutions unaware of extraction, (b) institutions benefiting and obscuring, or (c) different legitimate framings? Policy authority depends on answer.
