    ! GAP: Institutional "Rope" (Coordination) appears as "Mountain" (Natural Law) to the Powerless.
    ! DANGER: Cutting this constraint could be catastrophic for powerless individuals.

[PERSPECTIVAL GAP ANALYSIS]

  Analysis for Constraint: institutional_mutation_domestication
    ! GAP: Institutional "Rope" (Coordination) appears as "Mountain" (Natural Law) to the Powerless.
    ! DANGER: Cutting this constraint could be catastrophic for powerless individuals.
    - Individual (Powerless): mountain
    - Institutional (Manager): rope

[OMEGA GENERATION FROM PERSPECTIVAL GAPS]
  Generated 1 Omega variables from perspectival gaps:

  Ω: omega_cut_safety_institutional_mutation_domestication (conceptual)
     Question: Constraint institutional_mutation_domestication appears unchangeable (Mountain) to individuals but optional (Rope) to institutions. If institutions cut this "optional coordination," do individuals have alternatives, or does this destroy their only survival mechanism? Scaffold assessment required before any intervention.

  Analysis for Constraint: kleene_recursion_theorem
    ! GAP: Institutional "Rope" (Coordination) appears as "Mountain" (Natural Law) to the Powerless.
    ! DANGER: Cutting this constraint could be catastrophic for powerless individuals.
    - Individual (Powerless): mountain
    - Institutional (Manager): rope

[OMEGA GENERATION FROM PERSPECTIVAL GAPS]
  Generated 1 Omega variables from perspectival gaps:

  Ω: omega_cut_safety_kleene_recursion_theorem (conceptual)
     Question: Constraint kleene_recursion_theorem appears unchangeable (Mountain) to individuals but optional (Rope) to institutions.

    ! GAP: Institutional "Rope" (Coordination) appears as "Mountain" (Natural Law) to the Powerless.
    ! DANGER: Cutting this constraint could be catastrophic for powerless individuals.
    - Individual (Powerless): mountain
    - Institutional (Manager): rope

  Analysis for Constraint: peano_curve_mapping
    ! GAP: Institutional "Rope" (Coordination) appears as "Mountain" (Natural Law) to the Powerless.
    ! DANGER: Cutting this constraint could be catastrophic for powerless individuals.
    - Individual (Powerless): mountain
    - Institutional (Manager): rope

[OMEGA GENERATION FROM PERSPECTIVAL GAPS]
  Generated 1 Omega variables from perspectival gaps:

  Ω: omega_cut_safety_peano_curve_mapping (conceptual)
     Question: Constraint peano_curve_mapping appears unchangeable (Mountain) to individuals but optional (Rope) to institutions. If institutions cut this "optional coordination," do individuals have alternatives, or does this destroy their only survival mechanism? Scaffold assessment required before any intervention.

    ! GAP: Institutional "Rope" (Coordination) appears as "Mountain" (Natural Law) to the Powerless.
    ! DANGER: Cutting this constraint could be catastrophic for powerless individuals.
    - Individual (Powerless): mountain
    - Institutional (Manager): rope

[OMEGA GENERATION FROM PERSPECTIVAL GAPS]
  Generated 1 Omega variables from perspectival gaps:

  Ω: omega_cut_safety_poincare_conjecture (conceptual)
     Question: Constraint poincare_conjecture appears unchangeable (Mountain) to individuals but optional (Rope) to institutions. If institutions cut this "optional coordination," do individuals have alternatives, or does this destroy their only survival mechanism? Scaffold assessment required before any intervention.

[PERSPECTIVAL GAP ANALYSIS]

  Analysis for Constraint: reciprocity_laws_math
    ! GAP: Institutional "Rope" (Coordination) appears as "Mountain" (Natural Law) to the Powerless.
    ! DANGER: Cutting this constraint could be catastrophic for powerless individuals.
    - Individual (Powerless): mountain
    - Institutional (Manager): rope

[OMEGA GENERATION FROM PERSPECTIVAL GAPS]
  Generated 1 Omega variables from perspectival gaps:

  Ω: omega_cut_safety_reciprocity_laws_math (conceptual)
     Question: Constraint reciprocity_laws_math appears unchangeable (Mountain) to individuals but optional (Rope) to institutions. If institutions cut this "optional coordination," do individuals have alternatives, or does this destroy their only survival mechanism? Scaffold assessment required before any intervention.

[PERSPECTIVAL GAP ANALYSIS]

  Analysis for Constraint: rices_theorem_undecidability
    ! GAP: Institutional "Rope" (Coordination) appears as "Mountain" (Natural Law) to the Powerless.
    ! DANGER: Cutting this constraint could be catastrophic for powerless individuals.
    - Individual (Powerless): mountain
    - Institutional (Manager): rope

[OMEGA GENERATION FROM PERSPECTIVAL GAPS]
  Generated 1 Omega variables from perspectival gaps:

  Ω: omega_cut_safety_rices_theorem_undecidability (conceptual)
     Question: Constraint rices_theorem_undecidability appears unchangeable (Mountain) to individuals but optional (Rope) to institutions. If institutions cut this "optional coordination," do individuals have alternatives, or does this destroy their only survival mechanism? Scaffold assessment required before any intervention.

[PERSPECTIVAL GAP ANALYSIS]

  Analysis for Constraint: russells_paradox_self_reference
    ! GAP: Institutional "Rope" (Coordination) appears as "Mountain" (Natural Law) to the Powerless.
    ! DANGER: Cutting this constraint could be catastrophic for powerless individuals.
    - Individual (Powerless): mountain
    - Institutional (Manager): rope

[OMEGA GENERATION FROM PERSPECTIVAL GAPS]
  Generated 1 Omega variables from perspectival gaps:

  Ω: omega_cut_safety_russells_paradox_self_reference (conceptual)
     Question: Constraint russells_paradox_self_reference appears unchangeable (Mountain) to individuals but optional (Rope) to institutions. If institutions cut this "optional coordination," do individuals have alternatives, or does this destroy their only survival mechanism? Scaffold assessment required before any intervention.

  Analysis for Constraint: udhr_1948
    ! GAP: Institutional "Rope" (Coordination) appears as "Mountain" (Natural Law) to the Powerless.
    ! DANGER: Cutting this constraint could be catastrophic for powerless individuals.
    - Individual (Powerless): mountain
    - Institutional (Manager): rope

[OMEGA GENERATION FROM PERSPECTIVAL GAPS]

[PERSPECTIVAL GAP ANALYSIS]

  Analysis for Constraint: whitehead_problem_undecidability
    ! GAP: Institutional "Rope" (Coordination) appears as "Mountain" (Natural Law) to the Powerless.
    ! DANGER: Cutting this constraint could be catastrophic for powerless individuals.
    - Individual (Powerless): mountain
    - Institutional (Manager): rope

[OMEGA GENERATION FROM PERSPECTIVAL GAPS]
  Generated 1 Omega variables from perspectival gaps:

  Ω: omega_cut_safety_whitehead_problem_undecidability (conceptual)
     Question: Constraint whitehead_problem_undecidability appears unchangeable (Mountain) to individuals but optional (Rope) to institutions. If institutions cut this "optional coordination," do individuals have alternatives, or does this destroy their only survival mechanism? Scaffold assessment required before any intervention.
