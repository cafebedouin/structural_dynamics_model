# The Calm

The skua appears on Day 4, kilometer 320, holding position fifty meters back from the last sled. Soh watches it through the hab-module window during the midday rest stop, notes the white chest marking in the field journal. *Stercorarius antarcticus*, probable subadult, exhibiting corridor-following behavior consistent with prior seasonal observations.

By Day 6 the bird has brought seven others. They rotate through the air in loose formation, never closer than the fuel sleds, never farther than a hundred meters. Soh photographs their spacing patterns during equipment checks, documents how they ignore the crew except when Chen tosses apple cores during the evening meal—prohibited behavior, but no one reports it.

Petrov asks that night, cleaning grease from his hands: "They dangerous?"

"Only if you corner them," Soh says. "Give them space, they give you space."

Petrov nods, returns to the wrench work. Soh watches him go, thinks about adding a note—*Junior engineer unfamiliar with territorial behavior*—but the moment passes. The tractors need fuel. The satellite window opens in twenty minutes. There's always something else.

Day 7, morning: wind climbs from twenty-five knots to thirty-five. Visibility drops. Khatri stands at the nav console, watching the weather radar paint orange across the screen. "We push to five-forty," he says. "Hole up there until it passes."

The crew preps the hab-module. Soh secures the research equipment, double-checks the antenna mounts. Through the window: Petrov on perimeter watch, walking the boundary between the tractors and empty ice. The bird with the white chest marking lands fifteen meters from him. Cocks its head. Walks closer.

Petrov waves his arms—correct response, making himself large. The bird doesn't retreat. Walks closer. Petrov backs up now, less correct, and the bird reads it. Advances.

Soh is halfway to the door when the bird lunges. Skuas go for the head—it's territorial, not predatory, meant to drive away, not kill. Petrov raises his arm to block. The bird strikes with beak and talons. Petrov stumbles backward, reaches for something to steady himself, finds the ice axe leaning against the cargo sled.

The swing is reflexive. Wild. The axe catches the bird mid-flight.

Soh is running now, boots loud on hard snow, shouting "Stop—" but the word arrives too late. The bird falls. Lands wrong. One wing bent at an angle wings don't bend. Blood bright against white, impossibly bright, the only color in the monochrome world.

Petrov stands holding the axe, staring at his hands like they belong to someone else. "It attacked me."

Soh kneels beside the body. The bird is still moving but not alive-moving. Dying-moving. The kind of movement that's just neurons firing without purpose. "You killed it."

"It attacked me."

"You killed a Treaty-protected species."

The others arrive: Khatri, Osman, Chen, Ruiz. They form a circle around the blood. No one speaks. Wind at thirty-eight knots now, temperature dropping, storm front six hours out.

"What do we do?" Petrov's voice is small.

Khatri looks at the bird. At the blood. At the 520 kilometers behind them and 680 ahead. At the weather radar painting the sky orange. "We continue."

"We have to report—" Soh starts.

"We report this, season ends." Khatri's voice is flat. "Treaty investigation. Criminal prosecution. Everyone goes home. No one gets paid."

"It was self-defense," Osman says. "Bird attacked. We document it, file the report—"

"Or we don't." Chen crosses his arms. "Bird dies, we bury it, no one knows."

Ruiz: "That's evidence tampering."

Khatri: "That's survival." He looks at Soh. "You're the observer. You have documentation authority. This is your call."

The wind is loud. The blood is bright. The bird has stopped moving.

Soh says nothing.

They bury it in a crevasse at kilometer 521. No ceremony. Petrov does the digging. No one helps him. When it's done, they return to the tractors. The wind is forty-three knots. The storm will hit in four hours. They need to move.

At 0200 the wind stops.

Not dies down. Stops. Complete atmospheric halt. Soh wakes to the sound of nothing—no ventilation fan rattle, no wind against the module walls, no engine idle. Just silence, pure and absolute.

Outside: the air is motionless. Temperature plummeting without wind to mix it—radiative cooling dropping them toward sixty below. The sky is perfectly clear. Soh can see mountains that shouldn't be visible from here, atmospheric refraction bending light across a hundred kilometers of curvature.

Khatri is already at the comm desk, talking to McMurdo meteorology. "Negative on instrument malfunction. Confirmed zero wind at surface level. Visibility unlimited. Temperature five-eight below."

The voice from McMurdo: "You're in a thermal inversion dome. Scale is... unprecedented. Satellite shows clear air two hundred kilometers radius. Everywhere else, normal wind. Just you."

"Duration estimate?"

"Unknown. We've never seen one this size."

Khatri ends the call. Looks at Osman. "Engines?"

"Functional. But we can't move—no airflow cooling, we'll overheat in twenty minutes. And crew can't work in radiative cold this deep."

"How long can we wait?"

"Fuel for the heaters... if it stays calm, we burn reserve in five days. After that—" Osman doesn't finish. Doesn't need to.

Day 8: still calm. Chen runs diagnostics on every system. Everything works. Nothing moves.

Day 9: still calm. Soh goes outside at dawn, looks at the sky. No birds. The skuas are gone—all of them. Skuas need wind for soaring, thermal updrafts for hunting. In dead air they leave. They left the moment the wind stopped.

Ruiz notices Soh staring at the empty sky. "Maybe they know something."

"They know they can't fly here."

"Maybe they know why."

Soh doesn't answer.

Day 10: evening meal. Six people eating freeze-dried stroganoff in silence. Petrov hasn't spoken in two days. He eats mechanically, doesn't taste it.

"I'm sorry." His voice cracks the silence like ice. "I didn't mean to—"

"Shut up." Chen doesn't look up from his tray.

"I just—"

Osman: "Chen's right. Stop talking."

Soh: "It's not his fault. The bird attacked. Natural response."

Chen finally looks up. "Then why are you still documenting it?" Points at Soh's open field journal, meteorological anomaly notes covering three pages. "Your job is research, not judgment."

"My job is observation."

"Your job is whatever keeps us alive."

Khatri: "Everyone calm down."

Chen laughs, bitter. "We're dead calm already. Maybe that's the problem."

Ruiz, quiet: "What if it is?"

Everyone turns. Ruiz continues, slower now: "What if the calm isn't weather? What if it's—" Stops. Looks at the table.

"What, divine punishment?" Chen's voice drips contempt. "You think God cares about a bird?"

"I think the ice cares. I think the plateau knows."

Osman: "That's superstition."

"Then explain the calm. Explain why it started the moment we buried it."

Silence. Long. Heavy.

Then Khatri: "Even if—hypothetically—there were a connection, what would you propose we do?"

Ruiz doesn't answer immediately. When she does, her voice is careful: "Antarctic Treaty has protocols. When sacred sites are disturbed, there's remediation. Maybe we need—"

"Remediation?" Chen stands. "It's a dead bird."

Soh, quietly: "It's eight dead birds. The colony left. They're not coming back."

Day 11: fuel status critical. Osman wants to conserve. Chen wants to try moving anyway—risk the engine overheat, risk everything. They argue in technical language that barely masks the fear underneath. Petrov stops eating. Ruiz documents it: acute stress response, guilt spiral, monitor for self-harm indicators.

Day 12: Khatri calls a meeting. "Three options. Wait for wind, risk starvation. Attempt movement in calm, risk thermal death. Emergency beacon, request extraction."

"Extraction means explaining why we're stuck," Chen says.

"We don't know why we're stuck," Osman says.

"Yes we do." Chen looks at Petrov. "He killed the bird. Khatri covered it up. Soh documented it. We're all complicit. But it started with him."

Petrov: "I didn't mean—"

"Doesn't matter what you meant."

Ruiz: "Chen, this isn't—"

"Isn't what? Fair?" Chen's voice rises. "We're dying because he couldn't control himself. Maybe the plateau wants something. Maybe it wants balance." Pause. "Maybe it wants him."

The silence that follows is different from the others. This one has weight. Shape. Direction.

Khatri: "We are not—"

"Then what?" Chen spreads his hands. "We wait until we're eating each other? Or we acknowledge that this—" gestures to the windless void outside, "—started when he killed that bird, and maybe it ends when we balance the equation."

Soh: "You're talking about human sacrifice."

"I'm talking about survival."

No one votes. No one needs to. The silence is the vote.

When Petrov volunteers for perimeter check that evening, alone, no one stops him.

0300 hours, Day 13: Soh can't sleep. Goes outside. Finds Petrov sitting at the crevasse where they buried the bird, cross-legged in sixty-below cold, not moving.

Soh sits beside him. The cold is immediate, vicious. "You'll freeze."

"Maybe that's the point."

Long silence. Then Soh: "It's not your fault."

"Chen thinks it is."

"Chen is scared. We're all scared."

"The ice knows what I did."

"The ice is frozen water. It doesn't know anything."

"Then why is there no wind?"

Soh has no answer.

They sit. Petrov's breath comes in shallow clouds. His hands are bare—first sign of giving up. Soh notes this clinically, observer brain still functioning despite everything.

"I keep seeing it," Petrov says. "The moment the axe hit. The way it just... stopped. Like I turned off a switch. Life to not-life, instant."

"You were defending yourself."

"Was I?" Petrov looks at his hands. "Or was I just angry? Angry at this place, at the cold, at being the lowest on the crew, at everything. And the bird was there. And I could hit it. And I did."

Truth, finally. Soh says nothing. What is there to say?

"If the calm ends when I'm gone," Petrov says, "you should let me go."

"I'm not letting you die for meteorology."

"What if it's not meteorology?"

They sit until the sky begins to lighten. At 0630, Soh feels it first: a breath of wind. Gentle. Five knots. Then ten. Then fifteen. By 0800 it's twenty-five knots—normal plateau wind, temperature rising to survivable levels.

Khatri checks instruments. Calls McMurdo: "Inversion broke. We're mobile."

McMurdo: "Satellite confirms. Pressure gradient normalized. You're clear to Pole."

Khatri looks at Soh and Petrov returning from perimeter. Asks nothing. Just: "Prep for departure. We move in two hours."

They reach Amundsen-Scott on Day 22. Offload cargo. Standard procedure. No one mentions the calm. The incident report reads: *Meteorological anomaly, Days 8-13, cause unknown, no equipment damage, mission completed on schedule.*

Return journey: eighteen days, normal weather, professional silence. Chen avoids Petrov. Osman maintains equipment with obsessive focus. Ruiz prays quietly—Soh sees her lips moving, says nothing. Khatri navigates with mechanical precision.

Soh and Petrov develop a pattern: night watch together, sitting outside in the dark, not talking. The silence isn't empty. It's full of the thing they can't name.

Final approach to McMurdo, Day 40: operations manager conducts standard debrief. Equipment status? Functional. Route conditions? Normal. Incidents? None.

The lie is collective. The weight is individual.

Three months later, March 2194: Soh is in Seoul, analyzing data that means nothing anymore. Message from Petrov appears: *I need to talk. Can we video?*

The call connects. Petrov looks hollowed out, sleepless. "I can't stop thinking about it."

"The calm?"

"The bird. The moment I—" Can't finish. "I keep seeing it. Every time I close my eyes. And I need to tell someone who wasn't there. Someone who doesn't know. But I can't because they won't understand. They'll think I'm—"

"Crazy."

"Yes."

"I know."

They talk for three hours. Petrov tells the story: the attack, the axe, the blood, the burial, the calm, the cold, the crevasse, the wind returning. Tells it like confession. Like the telling might lift something.

It doesn't.

Two weeks later: same call. Same story. More details this time—the sound the axe made, the way the bird's eye looked, alive then not. Four hours.

This becomes pattern. Every two to three weeks: call, story, listening. Same narrative, slight variations. The story is alive, evolving, feeding on repetition.

Six months: twelve calls. Soh starts documenting this too, personal journal instead of research notes: *Why does he need to keep telling it? Why do I need to keep hearing it?*

One year: twenty-four calls. Soh realizes: when Soh closes eyes now, Soh sees the bird too. Sees the axe. Sees the blood. Sees the calm stretching forever.

The weight hasn't lifted. It's doubled.

November 2194: new Traverse season. Soh returns as Observer—different crew, same route. Day 6, kilometer 480: skua colony following, eight birds in loose formation.

The junior engineer, Mbatha, first season: "What's with the birds?"

Soh: "They follow for food. Don't feed them. Don't chase them. Just leave them alone."

"What if they attack?"

Soh stops walking. Looks at Mbatha. "They won't attack unless you threaten them. And if they do—" Long pause. "—let them. Whatever they do, don't hit back."

"That's not protocol."

"Protocol doesn't know everything."

"What happened last year?"

"Nothing happened."

"Then why do you look like that when you say it?"

And Soh—without planning, without deciding—starts talking. The bird. The axe. The calm. The cold. The guilt. The way Petrov still calls, still tells it, still can't stop.

Mbatha listens, increasingly disturbed. "Did you report it?"

"No."

"Why not?"

Soh realizes mid-answer: because reporting would end the story, and ending the story would mean the weight stays forever. Telling the story is the only way to move it. Even if moving it just means passing it to someone else.

"That's fucked up," Mbatha says.

"Yes."

"What happened to Petrov?"

"He's still in St. Petersburg. Still calls." Pause. "Last call was two months ago. Haven't heard from him since."

"Why are you telling me this?"

Soh doesn't answer. But Soh knows: the weight demanded transmission. The story found a host.

They continue walking. Ahead, the skuas follow. One has a white chest marking—distinctive, uncommon. It holds position fifty meters back from the last sled, watching.

Mbatha sees it too. "Is that—"

"No," Soh says quickly. "Different bird. Different season."

But Mbatha is still watching it, and Soh is still watching Mbatha, and the weight is still there, and the story is still moving, and the wind is still blowing, and the ice still knows.

The ice always knows.
