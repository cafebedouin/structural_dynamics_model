### Faint Blue

**Yuki – 12 January 2181**  
He came in late again. The stove light caught his face for just a second—sharper, like someone had adjusted the contrast. The kiss on my forehead was quick, certain. Not the old hesitant brush that used to linger half a second too long.  
I asked how the day went. He said “Productive” and smiled like the word tasted good.  
That smile stayed with me after he went to the study. It didn’t feel like his.

**Yuki – 18 April 2181**  
We actually ate breakfast together. First time in weeks. He talked about the new lab, the budget he’d fight for, the team he’d build. His voice didn’t waver once. He used my name twice, like he was testing how it sounded in the new tone.  
I told him he seemed different—more confident, almost lighter.  
He said the project was finally moving, that he was sleeping better.  
The legal supplements sat in the kitchen cabinet, labels facing out, exactly where I’d lined them up months ago. Evidence, I told myself.  
But his eyes slid past everything now. Past the food, past me.

**Yuki – 29 July 2181**  
I heard the study door lock from the hallway. Then the drawer—soft scrape, click. I know that sequence the way other people know their partner’s breathing.  
I stood with my hand on the knob. Didn’t turn it.  
If I asked and he answered smoothly, I’d know it was practiced.  
If I asked and he told the truth, I might not recognize the man who said it.

**Yuki – 2 October 2181**  
The weight is falling off him. Cheekbones sharper, collarbones showing when he reaches for a cup. There’s a tremor now—small, but I catch it every time.  
I asked if he’d see the occupational physician.  
He smiled that new calm smile and said it was just repetitive strain, everything under control.  
The kindness in his voice felt refrigerated.

**Yuki – 15 February 2182**  
I found one of the supplement bottles in the cabinet. Seal unbroken. Expiration date still a year away.  
I stood there holding it like an idiot, counting months backward.  
He walked in, saw it in my hand, didn’t slow down.  
“Just switched to a better batch,” he said, kissed my forehead, went to the study.  
The lock clicked behind him like punctuation.

**Yuki – 20 July 2182**  
He barely eats. The tremor is constant now; he rests his hands on the table to hide it.  
Last night I waited until his breathing evened out, then used the spare key I’d never touched before.  
The study drawer was locked. Of course.  
I stood in the dark listening to him sleep—or pretend—and realized the fear wasn’t that he’d hurt me.  
It was that whoever was breathing in the next room had already left without telling me.

**Yuki – 14 November 2182**  
I packed one small bag while he was at the lab.  
I left a note on the counter:  
“I can’t watch this anymore.”  
No signature. He would know whose handwriting it was.  
I turned off the stove light for the first time in years.

**Yuki – 15 December 2182**  
They called from the lab. Found him at his bench just after ten at night—vials scattered, notebook open, no pulse at first. Then faint.  
He’s in the hospital now. Coma. Neural scans show “extensive remodeling.” The doctors use careful words.  
I went back to the apartment. The study drawer was unlocked for once. Empty amber vials inside, faint blue residue glowing when I held the blacklight from his old equipment kit.  
One partial printout: modified phenethylamine, unknown catalytic impurity. No database match.  
His parents asked what happened. I said overwork, relentless pressure, the usual. His father looked at the sealed lab reports I wouldn’t hand over and didn’t ask again.  
Chen sent a short message: “If there’s anything I can do…” I left it unread.  
The notebook ends mid-line: “Attempting manual override via—”  
Via what? Higher dose? Cold withdrawal? Something worse?  
I sit in the apartment sometimes, stove light back on out of habit. His futon still laid out exactly as he left it.  
I open the study drawer, close it, open it again.  
The faint blue is almost gone now, but not quite.  
I keep asking the empty rooms what the override was.  
The wind outside gives the same answer every night.  
Nothing.  
Just the faint blue, waiting.
# Faint Blue



The lab smelled of ethanol and warm electronics, the same every morning. Kenji sat at his bench, the overhead lights still dimmed to half power. He tipped the powder onto a square of weighing paper—exactly one hundred milligrams now, the scale steady. The grains caught the blue glow of the fume hood display. He folded the paper, slipped it under his tongue, and waited.



Nineteen seconds to dissolve. He no longer needed the timer.



The bitterness spread, metallic and faintly sweet. He kept his eyes on the glassware lined up in front of him: round-bottom flasks, condensers, separatory funnels, all clean, all waiting for a reaction that would never come again. Twenty minutes. The room sharpened. The low hum of anxiety that usually lived behind his eyes moved outward, became something he could observe from a safe distance, like watching rain through a window.



Then the shift finished. Kenji became the thing watching Kenji. Ken stood up.



He checked the reflection in the dark glass of the hood. Same face, but the eyes had changed focus—outward now, scanning territory. He unlocked the bottom drawer. Twenty-one amber vials remained. Each held two grams. Forty doses per vial at current weight. Eight hundred and forty doses total. At four doses a day, two hundred and ten days left. 



Seven months exactly, if nothing changed.



Everything was changing.



Ken closed the drawer and walked the empty corridor to the elevator. The building was waking: footsteps on the floor above, the soft chime of someone arriving early. He nodded at the security guard—steady eye contact, small smile calibrated for approachability without warmth. The guard nodded back, reassured. Ken was good at reassurance.



In the elevator mirror he practiced the expression he would wear at the nine o’clock faculty meeting: attentive interest, slight forward lean, no hesitation when speaking. Tanaka would mention the directorship transition again. Ken needed to look ready without looking hungry. He had practiced this face for months.



The doors opened on the fourth floor. Dr. Suzuki was already at the coffee machine. Ken greeted him by name, asked about the weekend, listened to the answer while reading micro-expressions: fatigue, mild resentment about weekend data collection, underlying pride in the results. Useful information. He filed it.



Back when he was only Kenji, conversations like this left him drained. He would replay every sentence on the train home, searching for mistakes. Now the words arrived clean and left clean. No residue.



The meeting went as planned. Tanaka confirmed the timeline: formal handover in eight weeks. Chen sat across the table, smile polite, eyes measuring. She had lost, but she was still counting. Ken met her gaze once, held it long enough to acknowledge the count, not long enough to invite challenge. She looked away first.



Afterward, in the corridor, Suzuki lingered. “Hayashi-sensei,” he said, using the honorific carefully. “If there’s anything I can prepare for the new lab…”



Ken answered before the sentence finished. “Send me your current grant list by Friday. We’ll prioritize two for renewal.” Suzuki’s shoulders relaxed; alliance reinforced. Ken felt nothing about it. Efficiency, not friendship.



By noon he was back in the lab, hands steady enough to pipette without tremor when focused, but the tremor was always waiting. He took the second dose at 13:57. The third at 18:12, during a conference call with Mitsubishi Cognition Systems. The fourth at 22:44, alone again, lights low.



He worked until the building went quiet.



The apartment was dark when he arrived home shortly after midnight. Yuki had left the small light over the stove on, the way she always did. Her futon was already laid out in the bedroom; she slept facing the wall. He stood in the doorway a moment, watching the rise and fall of her breathing. She had asked fewer questions lately. Or perhaps he had become better at answers.



He went to the study, locked the door, opened the second locked drawer. Six vials here—emergency supply. Two hundred and forty doses. He transferred one to his pocket for morning. The rest stayed hidden behind stacks of old journals.



He remembered the first time Yuki had noticed something different. Four months in. They were eating breakfast—rice, miso, grilled salmon. She had studied his face and said, “You seem more… present lately. It’s nice.” He had smiled, told her the new project was going well, that he was sleeping better. She had accepted it. The lie had been small then.



Now the lies were structural. The apartment itself was divided: kitchen cabinet with the legal nootropics she could see, study drawer with the vials she never would. She had stopped opening this door when he was home.



He sat at the desk and opened his private notebook—paper, not digital, no cloud backup. The last entry was three days ago.



Remaining viable seed material: 1.8 g  
Estimated batches left: 9  
Estimated doses at current escalation: 378  
Days at 4 doses/day: 94



He added tonight’s numbers. Ninety-three days now.



He stared at the calculation until the numbers stopped meaning anything.



Somewhere in the back of the skull, a quieter voice—Kenji’s voice—whispered that ninety-three days was not enough. Not enough to hand over the lab smoothly. Not enough to secure the next round of funding. Not enough to become the person the directorship required permanently.



Ken closed the notebook. That voice belonged to an older operating system, one that worried about mistakes and judgment. Ken had no use for worry. Worry was inefficient.

He turned off the light and went to the bedroom. Yuki stirred when he lay down but did not turn toward him. He listened to her breathing even out again. The distance between their futons felt wider than the room allowed.



Morning came too early. He woke before the alarm, tremor already present in his fingers. He took the pocket vial into the bathroom, measured the dose under the exhaust fan. The powder dissolved. The bitterness was familiar now, almost comforting.



In the kitchen Yuki was making coffee. She glanced at him, eyes lingering on the hollows beneath his cheekbones, the faint shake in his hand as he reached for a cup.

“You’re not sleeping,” she said. Not a question.



“Big transition coming up.” His voice was steady, warm enough to sound caring.



She nodded, but her mouth tightened. She had stopped arguing weeks ago.



He drank the coffee black, kissed her forehead—brief contact, no lingering—and left for the lab.



The cycle repeated.



Days compressed into increments of dosage and performance. Meetings where he spoke without hesitation. Papers revised and submitted. Alliances strengthened. Chen watched from the edges, waiting for a misstep that had not yet come.



The tremor worsened. Colleagues noticed; he blamed repetitive strain. Sleep fractured into short segments. Appetite vanished; he lost another kilogram. Yuki left plates of food outside the study door. He ate when he remembered.



One evening in the twentieth month he sat in faculty dining with Tanaka and two visiting professors from Stanford. He had not dosed since 14:00. The gap stretched. Halfway through dessert the room tilted slightly, and for thirty seconds the old anxiety flooded back—raw, unfiltered. He felt every eye on him, every possible judgment. Then the residual chemistry caught up; the distance returned. No one noticed the flicker.



Later, alone in the lab, he realized what had happened: the state was becoming spontaneous. The brain no longer needed the trigger. Ken was learning to arrive on his own.

He should have been pleased. Instead the quieter voice surfaced again, thin and exhausted: We are running out of time to stop this.



Ken calculated remaining doses and ignored the voice.



In the twenty-second month he ran the final synthesis. The fume hood ran seventy-two hours straight. When it finished he had nine fresh vials. He labeled them carefully, lined them up under the light. The faint blue glow was weaker now; the impurity was thinning.



Total remaining: fifty-one vials across lab and home. Two thousand forty doses at one hundred milligrams. At four doses daily—twelve days. At five doses—ten days.

He wrote the numbers in the notebook.



Then he sat in the dark and looked at the vials for a long time.



Somewhere in the building a centrifuge spun down to silence. The ventilation hummed. He thought about the first dose, two years earlier, when everything had still felt like a choice.



He thought about Yuki asleep in the apartment, facing the wall.



He thought about the directorship ceremony scheduled in six weeks, the speech he would give, the colleagues who would applaud the man they believed him to be.



He thought about the ninety-three days that had become twelve.



The lab felt very quiet.



Ken closed the drawer. The lock clicked like a small, precise verdict.



Outside, Tsukuba’s winter wind moved through the campus trees, carrying nothing that could change the chemistry waiting inside the amber glass.

**Yuki – 12 January 2181**  
He came in late again. The light over the stove caught his face for a second—sharper somehow, like the shadows had rearranged themselves. He kissed my forehead the way he’s started doing: quick, certain. Not the old hesitant brush.  
I asked how the day went. He said “Productive” and smiled like he meant it.  
I don’t know why that smile made me uneasy.

**Yuki – 18 April 2181**  
We ate breakfast together for the first time in weeks. He talked about the new lab, the budget, the team he’d build. His voice was steady, almost warm. He used my name twice, like he was practicing it.  
I told him he seemed different lately—more confident.  
He said the project was going well, that he was finally sleeping properly.  
I wanted to believe him. The legal supplements are right there in the kitchen cabinet, lined up like evidence.  
But his eyes don’t linger on anything anymore. Not even on me.

Seed remaining: 9.1 g.

**Yuki – 29 July 2181**  
He locked the study door again. I heard the drawer open and close, the soft click I’ve started recognizing.  
I stood outside for a minute, hand on the knob.  
I didn’t turn it.  
If I ask and he lies, I’ll know he’s lying.  
If I ask and he tells the truth, I might not survive hearing it.

Risk acceptable.

**Yuki – 2 October 2181**  
He’s losing weight. The tremor started last month—barely there, but I see it when he reaches for his cup.  
I asked if he’d see the occupational physician.  
He said it was just strain, that everything was under control.  
His voice was calm, almost kind.  
That kindness felt farther away than anger would have.

**Notebook – 7 January 2182**

Dose: 100 mg × 4 daily.  
Effect duration stabilized at ~2 h per dose.  
Directorship competition intensifying. Counter-measures deployed.  
Chen’s accusation deflected successfully.

**Yuki – 15 February 2182**  
I found one of the legal supplement bottles untouched for months. The seal still intact.  
I stood in the kitchen holding it, feeling stupid for counting days.  
He came in, saw me with the bottle, and didn’t pause.  
Just said, “I switched batches—better formulation.”  
He kissed my forehead again and went to the study.  
The door locked behind him.

Remaining seed: 1.8 g. Final batches: 9.  
Doses at current escalation: ~360.  
Timeline: 90 days.  
Victory achieved. Collapse scheduled.

**Yuki – 20 July 2182**  
He barely eats. His hands shake even when he’s resting them on the table.  
Last night I waited until he was asleep—or pretending—and opened the study door with the spare key I’ve never used.  
The drawer was locked. Of course it was.  
I stood there in the dark, listening to him breathe in the next room, and realized I’m afraid of him now.  
Not that he’d hurt me.  
That he’s already gone.

**Notebook – 9 November 2182**

Final synthesis complete.  
Vials: 51 total (lab + home).  
Doses remaining: 2,040 @ 100 mg.

**Yuki – 14 November 2182**  
I packed a small bag this morning while he was at the lab.  
I didn’t take much.  
I left a note on the kitchen counter:  
“I can’t watch this anymore.”  
I didn’t sign it.  
He’ll understand.

Remaining: 0 doses. Depletion complete at 22:14.  
No reversal. Neural configuration locked in hybrid state.  
Attempting manual override via—

**Yuki Afterword – 15 December 2182**  
I returned to the apartment three days after the lab called. They said he'd been found slumped at his bench, vials scattered, notebook open. No pulse at first, then faint. Hospital now—induced coma, neural scans inconclusive. "Remodeling," they said. "Irreversible."  

I went through the study. The drawer was unlocked this time. Empty vials, faint residue glowing blue under blacklight.

I tested one—trace phenethylamine derivative, unknown impurity. No match in databases.  

His parents asked what happened. I said work stress, that he pushed too hard. They nodded, but his father stared at the locked lab reports I wouldn't share.  

Chen messaged: "If there's anything..." I didn't reply.  

The notebook ends mid-sentence. "Attempting manual override via—" Via what? More chemistry? Himself?  

I keep rereading the entries. The bifurcation he noted—Ken, efficient, necessary. Was that him, or the thing that replaced him?  

The apartment feels bifurcated now. His futon still laid out, untouched. The kitchen light I left on for him.  

I stand in the study sometimes, hand on the drawer knob. If I open it again, what lies inside? The truth, or just more blue glow fading?  

I close it. Listen to the wind outside. Wait for him to come home, knowing he won't. Not as himself. Not as anyone.  
What was the override? What did he attempt?  

The questions loop. The blue waits. Faint, but persistent.
