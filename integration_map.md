# Deferential Realism: Integration Map
## Discovered Concepts Across Eight Core Documents

**Purpose:** Track where each major concept should appear, identify gaps, consolidate terminology, and map extension opportunities.

**Status:** Working document for v3.3 integration revision

---

## I. Core Discovered Concepts

### 1. TANGLED ROPE (Hybrid Structure)

**Discovery:** Pattern mining revealed 36% of corpus shows irreducible coordination + extraction hybrid

**Current Coverage:**
- ✅ **logic.md**: Formal definition, Type VI error (two sub-errors), Theorem 4
- ✅ **core.md**: Explained with carbon credits example, empirical validation
- ✅ **sociology.md**: Prevalent in social structures, market examples
- ⚠️ **epistemology.md**: Mentioned but not systematically integrated into Six-Test Battery
- ⚠️ **ethics.md**: Missing - should inform reform virtue specifically
- ⚠️ **psychology.md**: No internal equivalent proposed (hybrid substrate/detritus?)
- ⚠️ **aesthetics.md**: Should have distinct aesthetic signature
- ⚠️ **metaphysics.md**: Should address ontological status of hybrids

**Integration Needs:**
- **epistemology.md**: Add to HDP as "hybrid detection protocol" - how to identify when extraction is baked into coordination
- **ethics.md**: "Reform Virtue" - preserve coordination, excise extraction (new cardinal virtue?)
- **psychology.md**: Internal tangled patterns (habits that serve + harm simultaneously)
- **aesthetics.md**: "Tragic beauty" - graceful coordination marred by extraction
- **metaphysics.md**: Hybridity as primitive (not emergent) - constraints can be fundamentally dual-natured

**Terminology Consolidation:**
- Currently stable: "Tangled Rope" works metaphorically across domains
- Keep consistent across all docs

**Extension Opportunities:**
- **Institutional Design**: Most institutions are Tangled Ropes - how to design for separability?
- **Software Architecture**: Dependencies that provide utility but lock-in (vendor Tangled Ropes)
- **Constraint Lifecycle**: Do pure Ropes calcify into Tangled Ropes over time?

---

### 2. CONTAINMENT LOGIC (Irresolvable Paradoxes)

**Discovery:** Some tensions are structurally permanent - resolution demand is itself a clarity fetish

**Current Coverage:**
- ✅ **psychology.md**: Six-step protocol, autonomy/connection example, anti-transcendence stance
- ✅ **sociology.md**: Paradox examples (autonomy/connection, security/growth)
- ⚠️ **epistemology.md**: Missing - should be epistemic stance on uncertainty
- ⚠️ **ethics.md**: Missing - should be virtue of paradox-holding
- ⚠️ **logic.md**: Missing - formal logic of non-resolvable tensions
- ⚠️ **metaphysics.md**: Missing - ontological status of paradoxes
- ⚠️ **aesthetics.md**: Mentioned (paradox-holding is mature) but not developed
- ❌ **core.md**: Not present

**Integration Needs:**
- **epistemology.md**: "Epistemic Humility" - some questions have no answer, containment is the answer
- **ethics.md**: "Wisdom Virtue" or "Paradox Virtue" - holding tension without forcing resolution
- **logic.md**: Formal treatment of non-resolvable dilemmas (not contradictions)
- **metaphysics.md**: Paradoxes as structural features of finite agency, not problems to solve
- **aesthetics.md**: Expand - grace of held tension vs. ugliness of forced resolution
- **core.md**: Brief mention in "what this framework does" section

**Terminology Consolidation:**
- "Containment" vs. "Holding" vs. "Navigation" - need consistent term
- Proposal: **"Containment"** for the practice, **"Paradox"** for the structure

**Extension Opportunities:**
- **Conflict Resolution**: When to stop trying to resolve and start containing
- **Institutional Design**: Building paradox-tolerance into governance
- **Discomfort vs. Damage**: Containment produces ongoing discomfort but not damage

---

### 3. POWER-SCALING MECHANISM (π(P) Modifier)

**Discovery:** Same constraint shows different extraction based on power position - explains variance without hidden variables

**Current Coverage:**
- ✅ **logic.md**: Formal definition, Theorem 3, explains 8.2% → 0% collision reduction
- ✅ **core.md**: Explained with carbon credits example showing differential experience
- ✅ **sociology.md**: Market dynamics examples, power position effects
- ⚠️ **epistemology.md**: Mentioned in indices but not as core mechanism

- ⚠️ **psychology.md**: Missing - internal power differentials?
- ⚠️ **metaphysics.md**: Missing - power as structural property vs. accidental
- ⚠️ **aesthetics.md**: Missing - does power-position affect aesthetic judgment?

**Integration Needs:**
- **epistemology.md**: Power analysis as epistemic requirement (Section on HDP)
- **ethics.md**: Indexed obligation - what you should do depends on power position
- **psychology.md**: Internal power dynamics (ego states, part work, IFS parallels?)
- **metaphysics.md**: Power as structural property that modulates extraction
- **aesthetics.md**: Indexed beauty - what's beautiful from one position may be ugly from another

**Terminology Consolidation:**
- "Power-scaling" vs. "Power modifier" vs. "π(P)" - currently mixed
- Proposal: **"Power-scaling mechanism"** in prose, **π(P)** in formal logic

**Extension Opportunities:**
- **Institutional Design**: How to design for power-awareness
- **Cross-Domain Isomorphism**: Internal (ego states) ↔ External (social hierarchy)
- **Discomfort vs. Damage**: Power determines whether violation causes discomfort or damage

---

### 4. PITON DETECTION PATTERN

**Discovery:** High-maintenance, low-benefit constraints signal resource waste - diagnostic not type

**Current Coverage:**
- ✅ **logic.md**: Type V error, detection pattern, bypass vs. eliminate
- ✅ **aesthetics.md**: Audit protocol (weekly/monthly), melancholic inertia
- ✅ **core.md**: Explained as degradation state, not fundamental type
- ⚠️ **epistemology.md**: Missing - should be detection method
- ⚠️ **psychology.md**: Missing - internal pitons (obsolete self-protective patterns)
- ⚠️ **ethics.md**: Missing - duty to eliminate waste
- ⚠️ **sociology.md**: Mentioned but not systematically integrated
- ⚠️ **metaphysics.md**: Missing - degradation as ontological process

**Integration Needs:**
- **epistemology.md**: "Piton detection protocol" in methodology section
- **psychology.md**: Empty Tombs (internal pitons) - make explicit connection
- **ethics.md**: "Conservation Virtue" includes eliminating pitons
- **sociology.md**: Social pitons (obsolete norms, dead letter laws)
- **metaphysics.md**: Temporal degradation - how constraints lose function

**Terminology Consolidation Problem:**
- **"Piton"** (was: Zombie) (external dead constraint)
- **"Empty Tomb"** (internal historical constraint)
- **"Detritus"** (clearable internal constraint)
- **"Scaffold calcification"** (temporary support that didn't sunset)

**Proposed Unification:**
- **"Piton"** = degradation state across domains (keeps metaphorical consistency)
- **"Empty Tomb"** = specific psychological piton type (historical necessity → current irrelevance)
- **"Detritus"** = broader category including Empty Tombs + other clearable patterns
- **Drop "Scaffold calcification"** → just call it "Piton (failed Scaffold)"

**Extension Opportunities:**
- **Constraint Lifecycle**: Rope → Tangled Rope → Piton (temporal degradation model)
- **Institutional Design**: Sunset clauses as piton prevention
- **Software Development**: Technical debt as piton code
- **Architecture**: Obsolete design elements (skeuomorphs as architectural pitons)

---

### 5. SCAFFOLD TEMPORAL LOGIC

**Discovery:** Not a constraint type but temporal property (WHEN index) + explicit sunset clause

**Current Coverage:**
- ✅ **core.md**: Explained as temporal property, not distinct type
- ✅ **logic.md**: Noted as time-limited rope
- ⚠️ **epistemology.md**: Missing - temporal testing as part of HDP

- ⚠️ **sociology.md**: Missing - temporary social supports
- ⚠️ **aesthetics.md**: Present (celebrate dissolution) but not developed
- ⚠️ **metaphysics.md**: Missing - temporality as structural property

**Integration Needs:**
- **epistemology.md**: "Temporal testing" - does this have sunset clause? Is expiration planned?

- **psychology.md**: Developmental scaffolds (therapist, mentor, training program)
- **sociology.md**: Social scaffolds (emergency measures, transition programs)
- **aesthetics.md**: Expand "grace of dissolution" - beauty of well-timed endings
- **metaphysics.md**: Temporality as primary property vs. spatial permanence

**Terminology Consolidation:**
- "Scaffold" is stable and works well
- Keep consistent across all docs

**Extension Opportunities:**
- **Institutional Design**: Building sunset clauses into policy
- **Software Development**: Feature flags, beta testing, gradual rollout
- **Discomfort vs. Damage**: Scaffold removal causes discomfort (growth pains) not damage
- **Hidden Tangled Rope**: Scaffolds that claim temporality but extract rent (VC funding that demands control)

---

### 6. INDEXICAL RELATIVITY AS ONTOLOGICAL CORE

**Current Coverage:**
- ✅ **logic.md**: Theorem 1 (core), formal treatment
- ✅ **core.md**: THE organizing principle, explained thoroughly

- **Ensure metaphysics.md** treats this as primary claim

**Terminology Consolidation:**
- "Indexical relativity" is stable
- Sometimes called "perspective-dependence" - consolidate to one term
- Proposal: **"Indexical relativity"** (technical), **"position-dependence"** (accessible)

**Extension Opportunities:**
- **Cross-Domain Isomorphism**: Same indexical logic applies internally and externally
- **Conflict Resolution**: Conflicts often arise from unspecified indices
- **Institutional Design**: Designing for multi-perspectival truth

- **Liberatory Practice**: Methodology for detecting and clearing internalized oppression
- **Trauma Theory**: How trauma creates substrate from historical Snares
- **Constraint Lifecycle**: External Snare → Internalized pattern → Substrate or Detritus (depends on testing)
- **Cross-Domain Isomorphism**: Same structure, different location (external ↔ internal)

---

## II. Negative Space & Related Concepts

### 8. DISCOMFORT vs. DAMAGE (Boundary Principle)

- **Scaffold Removal**: Growth discomfort vs. premature removal damage
- **Institutional Design**: Systems that tolerate discomfort without creating damage

---

### 9. CONSTRAINT LIFECYCLES (Temporal Transitions)

**Current Coverage:**
- ⚠️ **core.md**: Mentioned as "temporal transition mechanics" in limitations
- ⚠️ **logic.md**: Implied by temporal operators but not explicit lifecycle model
- ⚠️ **aesthetics.md**: Piton as degraded state implies lifecycle
- ❌ **epistemology.md**: Not addressed
- ❌ **psychology.md**: String of Pearls touches this but not explicit lifecycle
- ❌ **sociology.md**: Not addressed
- ❌ **ethics.md**: Not addressed
- ❌ **metaphysics.md**: Not addressed

**Integration Needs:**
- **NEW DOCUMENT?**: "Constraint Lifecycles" as extension document?

3. **Mountain → Rope** (technological/social change makes changeable)
4. **Snare → Mountain** (naturalization/internalization)
5. **Snare → Piton** (enforcement collapse but structure persists)

**Extension Opportunities:**
- **Institutional Design**: Lifecycle awareness in governance
- **Software Development**: Technical debt as degradation lifecycle

---

### 10. INSTITUTIONAL DESIGN EXTENSIONS

**Discovery:** Framework has clear applications to deliberate system creation

**Current Coverage:**
- ❌ Not systematically addressed in any document
- Scattered mentions (sociology has some market examples, aesthetics has creation principles)

**Integration Needs:**
- **NEW DOCUMENT?**: "Institutional Design Guide" as applied extension?
- **Core principles derived from existing docs:**
  - Start with Mountains (design around genuine limits)
  - Build light Ropes (minimal coordination rules)
  - Avoid hidden Snares (transparent extraction)
  - Use Scaffolds wisely (temporal support with sunset clauses)

  2. Is this a Paradox (contain) vs. solvable problem (resolve)?
  3. What's the constraint type from each position? (Indexed analysis)
  4. Is discomfort being confused with damage?
  5. Is there a Tangled Rope that needs reform vs. elimination?

**Extension Opportunities:**
- **Interpersonal**: Relationship conflict diagnosis
- **Organizational**: Team dysfunction analysis

- **Therapeutic**: When to work on issue vs. accept limitation

---

### 12. CROSS-DOMAIN ISOMORPHIC CATEGORIES

**Current Coverage:**
- ✅ **psychology.md**: Explicit integration table (External ↔ Internal mapping)
- ⚠️ **sociology.md**: Integration sections but not systematic isomorphism
- ❌ Other docs: Not systematically addressed

**Isomorphic Mappings Identified:**

- Tangled Rope (hybrid social) ↔ ??? (hybrid internal patterns?)
- Piton (degraded external) ↔ Empty Tomb (degraded internal)
- Scaffold (temporary external) ↔ Developmental Support (temporary internal)
- Paradox (external trade-off) ↔ Internal Tension (autonomy/connection)

**Extension Opportunities:**
- **Cross-domain learning**: Insights from one domain apply to another
- **Unified methodology**: Same testing protocol works everywhere
- **Conceptual economy**: Fewer primitives needed

---

## III. Unified Climbing Metaphor System

### Core Metaphor: Constraint-Space as Mountain Terrain

**Organizing principle:** All constraints are aspects of navigating difficult terrain. The climber must distinguish:
- What cannot be changed (mountains, cliffs)
- What aids progress (ropes, scaffolds)
- What traps or restricts (snares, tangles)
- What appears supportive but fails (pitons)

### Terminology Consolidation & Climbing Mappings:

1. **External Constraint Types (keep climbing metaphor):**
   - **Mountain** ✅ - Immovable terrain requiring navigation
   - **Rope** ✅ - Coordination tool enabling collective ascent
   - **Tangled Rope** ✅ - Support that binds/restricts (coordination + extraction)
   - **Snare** (was: Noose) - Trap disguised as path/holds
   - **Scaffold** ✅ - Temporary structure for construction/transition
   - **Piton** (was: Zombie) - Old anchor point that no longer holds

2. **Internal Constraint Types (extend climbing metaphor):**
   - **Bedrock** (was: Substrate) - Geological foundation, cannot be moved
   - **Talus** (was: Detritus) - Loose rock/debris at cliff base, clearable
   - **Summit Fever** (was: Clarity Fetish) - Peak obsession causing dangerous decisions
   - **Empty Tomb** → **Abandoned Camp** - Historical site, no longer occupied

3. **Detection Patterns:**
   - **False Summit** (was: False Mountain) - Appears as peak but another ridge beyond
   - **Overhang** (new) - Section requiring traverse, not ascent (paradox navigation)

4. **Holding Paradox:**
   - Current: Containment, holding, navigating tension
   - Climbing: **Traversing the Overhang** (process), **Overhang** (structure)
   - Keep: **Containment** (clearer for non-climbers)

5. **Power Effects:**
   - Current: Power-scaling, power modifier, π(P)
   - Climbing: **Altitude Effect** (position on mountain affects extraction experience)
   - Keep: **Power-scaling mechanism** (clearer), **π(P)** (formal)

6. **Position-Dependence:**
   - Current: Indexical relativity, perspective-dependence
   - Climbing: **Position on Route** (different views from different points)
   - Keep: **Indexical relativity** (technical), **position-dependence** (accessible)

### Unified Terminology (Final):

**External Constraints:**
- ✅ Mountain (immovable terrain)
- ✅ Rope (coordination tool)  
- ✅ Tangled Rope (coordination + extraction hybrid)
- ✅ Snare (was: Noose - extractive trap)
- ✅ Scaffold (temporary support)
- ✅ Piton (was: Zombie - failed old anchor)

**Internal Constraints (Psychology):**
- 🤔 Bedrock (was: Substrate - consider)
- 🤔 Talus (was: Detritus - consider)
- 🤔 Summit Fever (was: Clarity Fetish - consider)
- 🤔 Abandoned Camp (was: Empty Tomb - consider)

**Detection Patterns:**
- ✅ False Summit (was: False Mountain)
- ✅ Overhang (new - for paradoxes requiring traverse)

**Practices:**
- ✅ Containment (holding paradoxes)
- ✅ Indexical relativity (position-dependence)
- ✅ Power-scaling mechanism (altitude effects)

**Decision:** Internal constraint renaming is OPTIONAL pending user testing. External changes (Noose→Snare, Zombie→Piton) are RECOMMENDED for semantic coherence.

**Why climbing works:**
- **Constraint-space as terrain**: Natural extension of "Mountain" concept
- **Navigation focus**: Climbing is about finding paths, not conquering
- **Collective activity**: Ropes connect climbers (coordination metaphor)
- **Risk management**: Distinguishing safe from unsafe holds (classification)
- **Position matters**: Different challenges at different altitudes (indexical relativity)
- **Equipment evolution**: Old pitons vs. new gear (temporal degradation)

**Why this is better than mixed metaphors:**
- **Conceptual economy**: One root metaphor for all constraint types
- **Intuitive extension**: New concepts naturally extend the climbing frame
- **Non-climber accessibility**: Basic climbing concepts (rope, scaffold, trap) are culturally familiar
- **Avoids violence**: "Snare" less visceral than "Noose" while keeping trap concept
- **Technical precision**: Climbing has rich vocabulary for constraint types

| `tangled_rope` | Keep | 0 | NONE | No change needed |
| `mountain` | Keep | 0 | NONE | No change needed |
| `rope` | Keep | 0 | NONE | No change needed |
| `scaffold` | Keep | 0 | NONE | No change needed |

**Prolog files requiring updates:**
- `drl_core.pl` - Core classification predicates

- `structural_signatures.pl` - Type signatures
- `test_harness.pl` - All test cases
- `validation_suite.pl` - Validation predicates
- Individual constraint files (100+ files in corpus)

**Config parameter renames:**
```prolog
% OLD → NEW
noose_extraction_floor → snare_extraction_floor
noose_suppression_floor → snare_suppression_floor
piton_extraction_ceiling → piton_extraction_ceiling
tangled_rope_extraction_ceil → (KEEP)
```

### Phase 2: Markdown Documents (All 8 Core Docs)

**Required changes in all .md files:**

| Noose(s) | Snare(s) | All prose | ~200 |
| noose | snare | Code blocks | ~50 |
| Piton(s) | Piton(s) | All prose | ~100 |
| piton | piton | Code blocks | ~30 |
| Empty Tomb(s) | Abandoned Camp(s) | Psychology only | ~20 |

**Case-sensitive replacements needed:**
- "Noose" → "Snare" (capitalized, sentence start)
- "noose" → "snare" (lowercase, inline)
- "Nooses" → "Snares" (plural)
- Same for Piton/Piton

**Context-specific exceptions:**
- Historical quotes mentioning "noose" (keep original)

## VIII. Revision Workflow Proposal

### Phase 1: Terminology Consolidation
- [ ] Review all 8 docs for terminology variance
- [ ] Create unified glossary
- [ ] Apply consistent terms across all docs

### Phase 2: Core Concept Integration (Tier 1)
- [ ] Tangled Rope → All 8 docs
- [ ] Containment Logic → All 8 docs  
- [ ] Indexical Relativity → Elevate in all docs

### Phase 3: Framework Utility Integration (Tier 2)
- [ ] Piton Detection → Systematic integration
- [ ] Power-Scaling → Complete integration
- [ ] Discomfort vs. Damage → All testing contexts

### Phase 4: Extension Documents (Tier 3)
- [ ] Draft Constraint Lifecycles document
- [ ] Draft Institutional Design guide
- [ ] Draft Conflict Resolution methodology
- [ ] Draft Cross-Domain Isomorphism document (or expand core.md)

### Phase 5: Cross-Reference Audit
- [ ] Ensure all concepts appear where needed
- [ ] Verify terminology consistency
- [ ] Check for contradictions
- [ ] Validate empirical claims alignment

### Phase 6: Coherence Test
- [ ] Read all 8 docs as integrated whole
- [ ] Check for conceptual gaps
- [ ] Verify logical flow between documents
- [ ] Ensure no orphaned concepts

## IX. Open Questions for Discussion

1. **Should Tangled Rope have internal psychological equivalent?**
   - Patterns that simultaneously serve and harm
   - Example: Perfectionism (protects via standards + damages via impossible demands)

2. **Is "Wisdom" or "Paradox" better name for Containment virtue?**
   - Wisdom: Traditional, implies depth
   - Paradox: Technical, matches structure

3. **Should we create "Constraint Lifecycles" document or expand metaphysics.md?**
   - Separate: Clearer, allows detail
   - Integrated: More coherent, less fragmentation

4. **How much should institutional design be in core docs vs. separate applied guides?**
   - Core: Principles only
   - Separate: Detailed applications

5. **Should cross-domain isomorphism be core.md expansion or separate integration document?**
   - Core.md: More accessible
   - Separate: Allows thorough treatment

6. **Terminology: "Containment" vs. "Holding" vs. "Navigation" for paradoxes?**
   - Containment: Spatial metaphor (boundaries)
   - Holding: Relational metaphor (care)
   - Navigation: Movement metaphor (strategy)

7. **Should Scaffold calcification that creates Tangled Rope be called out explicitly?**
   - VC funding that demands control
   - Emergency powers that become permanent
   - Temporary support that extracts rent

8. **How to handle uncertainty about whether something is substrate or detritus?**
   - Current: Test edges systematically
   - Addition: Uncertainty tolerance protocol?
