  MISSING_NL_PROFILE: Mountain candidate is missing required NL profile data: accessibility_collapse, resistance. Without these, the mountain metric gate will not fire (emerges_naturally) and/or the natural_law_signature certification will fail (accessibility_collapse and resistance default to 0.5). Add the missing declarations or reclassify the constraint.
