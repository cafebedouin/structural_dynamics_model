### 1. Snare: `adverse_possession`

*   **Claimed Type:** `snare`
*   **Severity:** `N/A`
*   **Perspectival Breakdown:**
*   **Structural Signature Analysis:** FALSE CI_ROPE signature for adverse_possession: Appears to be rope (indexed_rope_classification) but fails 2 Boltzmann structural test(s): [excess_above_floor(0.6),nonsensical_coupling(0.16666666666666666)]. Coupling score=1.0. This constraint is "coordination-washed" — it hides extraction behind low metrics, distributed enforcement, or behavioral defaults.
    → Institutional beneficiary: squatter_or_possessor
    → Institutional d=0.120

- Is this their only survival mechanism?
- What scaffolding exists for transition?
2. Test institutional perception:
- Can institutions unilaterally change this?
- Do they understand downstream impacts?
- Is their "optional" view empirically accurate?
3. Decision tree:
IF truly unchangeable → Correct institutional view to MOUNTAIN

1. Document competing value frameworks:
- What values support current unknown?
- What values oppose it?
- Are these incommensurable?
2. Propose scaffolded solution:
- Design mechanism respecting both value sets
- Create exit options for dissenters
- Allow preference-based sorting
3. Accept unresolvability if necessary:
- Some omegas represent genuine value pluralism
- Solution: coexistence, not consensus
