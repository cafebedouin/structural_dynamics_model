### 1. Snare: `adverse_possession`

*   **Claimed Type:** `snare`
*   **Severity:** `N/A`
*   **Perspectival Breakdown:**
*   **Structural Signature Analysis:** FALSE CI_ROPE signature for adverse_possession: Appears to be rope (indexed_rope_classification) but fails 2 Boltzmann structural test(s): [excess_above_floor(0.6),nonsensical_coupling(0.16666666666666666)]. Coupling score=1.0. This constraint is "coordination-washed" — it hides extraction behind low metrics, distributed enforcement, or behavioral defaults.
    → Institutional beneficiary: squatter_or_possessor
    → Institutional d=0.120

- Can you change/exit this constraint?
- What would happen if you tried?
2. Interview institutional actors (N=10+):
- What function does arctic_geopolitical_flashpoint serve?

- What alternatives exist?
3. Document benefit flows:
- Track who gains vs. who loses from status quo
- Measure asymmetric benefit distribution
4. Decision tree:
IF extraction confirmed → Reclassify as SNARE
IF functional & fair → Reclassify as ROPE

### 24. Snare: `faint_blue_neural_bifurcation`

*   **Claimed Type:** `snare`
*   **Severity:** `N/A`

Coupling score=0.750 with 0 coupled dimension pairs. Excess extraction=0.85. This constraint is "physics-washed" — it appears natural but its coupling topology reveals structural construction.

1. Map stakeholder perspectives:
- Document how different actors perceive metamorphosis_samsa
- Identify source of divergence
2. Gather evidence:
- Empirical metrics (suppression, extraction, resistance)
- Historical behavior patterns
3. Create indexical classification:
- From powerless context: classify as X
- From institutional context: classify as Y
- Add explicit context annotations

### 41. Snare: `micro_robot_electronics_integration`

*   **Claimed Type:** `snare`
*   **Severity:** `N/A`
*   **Perspectival Breakdown:**
*   **Structural Signature Analysis:** FALSE CI_ROPE signature for micro_robot_electronics_integration: Appears to be rope (indexed_rope_classification) but fails 2 Boltzmann structural test(s): [excess_above_floor(0.15000000000000002),nonsensical_coupling(0.16666666666666666)]. Coupling score=0.375. This constraint is "coordination-washed" — it hides extraction behind low metrics, distributed enforcement, or behavioral defaults.
    → Institutional beneficiary: mechanical_simplicity
    → Institutional d=0.120
  ek_robot_integration_cycle: constructed_low_extraction (confidence: low)
    → CONSTRUCTED LOW-EXTRACTION signature for ek_robot_integration_cycle: Enforcement present (suppression=0.10, resistance=0.50) but extraction is low (0.10). This is a rule-based coordination structure, not an extraction mechanism.

### 74. Snare: `zombie_reasoning_2026`

*   **Claimed Type:** `snare`
*   **Severity:** `N/A`
*   **Perspectival Breakdown:**
*   **Structural Signature Analysis:** FALSE CI_ROPE signature for zombie_reasoning_2026: Appears to be rope (indexed_rope_classification) but fails 3 Boltzmann structural test(s): [boltzmann_non_compliant(1.0,0.25),excess_above_floor(0.69),nonsensical_coupling(0.16666666666666666)]. Coupling score=1.0. This constraint is "coordination-washed" — it hides extraction behind low metrics, distributed enforcement, or behavioral defaults.
    → Institutional beneficiary: generative_ai_marketing
    → Institutional d=0.120
