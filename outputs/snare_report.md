1. Test changeability:
- Can institutions modify ai_cognitive_diversity_arbitrage?
- What legal/political mechanisms exist?
- Historical precedents of change?
2. Test extraction:
- Is benefit flow symmetric or asymmetric?
- Who has veto power over changes?
3. Decision tree:
IF truly unchangeable + extractive → MANDATROPHY
IF changeable + extractive → Correct to SNARE
IF unchangeable + fair → Correct to MOUNTAIN
IF institutions falsely claim necessity → SNARE + fraud flag

*   **Related Gap/Alert:** ! ALERT: Extractive "Snare" is masked as functional "Rope".
*   **Generated Omega:** omega_extraction_blindness_zombie_reasoning_2026 (conceptual)
*   **Suggested Resolution Strategy:**
    ```
1. Interview affected individuals (N=10+):
- Who benefits from zombie_reasoning_2026?
- Can you change/exit this constraint?
- What would happen if you tried?
2. Interview institutional actors (N=10+):
- What function does zombie_reasoning_2026 serve?
- Who would object to removing it?
- What alternatives exist?
3. Document benefit flows:
- Track who gains vs. who loses from status quo
- Measure asymmetric benefit distribution
4. Decision tree:
IF extraction confirmed → Reclassify as SNARE
IF functional & fair → Reclassify as ROPE
IF context-dependent → Add indexical resolution
    ```
