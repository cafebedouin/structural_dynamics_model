### 1. Omega: `omega_cut_safety_academic_peer_review_gatekeeping`

*   **Severity:** `N/A`
*   **Associated Constraint:** `academic_peer_review_gatekeeping`
*   **Source Gap:** `gap(mountain_coordination_confusion,mountain,rope)`
*   **Question:** Constraint academic_peer_review_gatekeeping appears unchangeable (Mountain) to individuals but optional (Rope) to institutions...
*   **Suggested Resolution Strategy:**
    ```
1. SAFETY ASSESSMENT (DO NOT SKIP):
- If institutions cut academic_peer_review_gatekeeping, do individuals have alternatives?
- Is this their only survival mechanism?
- What scaffolding exists for transition?
2. Test institutional perception:
- Can institutions unilaterally change this?
- Do they understand downstream impacts?
- Is their "optional" view empirically accurate?
3. Decision tree:
IF truly unchangeable → Correct institutional view to MOUNTAIN
IF changeable + safe alternatives → Correct powerless view to ROPE
IF changeable + NO alternatives → ADD SCAFFOLD before any change

    ```
1. SAFETY ASSESSMENT (DO NOT SKIP):
- If institutions cut three_body_unpredictability, do individuals have alternatives?
- Is this their only survival mechanism?
- What scaffolding exists for transition?
2. Test institutional perception:
- Can institutions unilaterally change this?
- Do they understand downstream impacts?
- Is their "optional" view empirically accurate?
3. Decision tree:
IF truly unchangeable → Correct institutional view to MOUNTAIN
IF changeable + safe alternatives → Correct powerless view to ROPE
IF changeable + NO alternatives → ADD SCAFFOLD before any change
IF uncertainty → HALT changes until resolved
4. CRITICAL: Never proceed with changes until safety verified
