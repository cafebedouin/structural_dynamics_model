*   **Question:** Constraint academic_peer_review_gatekeeping appears unchangeable (Mountain) to individuals but optional (Rope) to institutions...
*   **Suggested Resolution Strategy:**
    ```
1. Design measurement protocol for unknown
2. Collect data from N=30+ real-world instances
3. Calculate empirical metrics:
- suppression_requirement (enforcement needed)
- resistance_to_change (pushback level)

1. Map stakeholder perspectives:
- Document how different actors perceive stoic_logos_governance
- Identify source of divergence
2. Gather evidence:
- Empirical metrics (suppression, extraction, resistance)
- Historical behavior patterns
3. Create indexical classification:
- From powerless context: classify as X
- From institutional context: classify as Y
- Add explicit context annotations
    ```
