### 1. Omega: `omega_cut_safety_academic_peer_review_gatekeeping`

*   **Severity:** `N/A`
*   **Associated Constraint:** `academic_peer_review_gatekeeping`
*   **Source Gap:** `gap(mountain_coordination_confusion,mountain,rope)`
*   **Question:** Constraint academic_peer_review_gatekeeping appears unchangeable (Mountain) to individuals but optional (Rope) to institutions...
*   **Suggested Resolution Strategy:**
    ```
1. Design measurement protocol for unknown
2. Collect data from N=30+ real-world instances
3. Calculate empirical metrics:
- suppression_requirement (enforcement needed)
- resistance_to_change (pushback level)
- base_extractiveness (asymmetric benefit flow)
4. Update constraint_metric/3 declarations with data
5. Re-run classification to resolve perspectival gap
    ```

    ```
1. Interview affected individuals (N=10+):
- Who benefits from 26usc469_real_estate_exemption?
- Can you change/exit this constraint?
- What would happen if you tried?
2. Interview institutional actors (N=10+):
- What function does 26usc469_real_estate_exemption serve?
- Who would object to removing it?
- What alternatives exist?
3. Document benefit flows:
- Track who gains vs. who loses from status quo
