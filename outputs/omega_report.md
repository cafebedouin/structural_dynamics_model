### 1. Omega: `omega_cut_safety_academic_peer_review_gatekeeping`

*   **Severity:** `critical`
*   **Associated Constraint:** `academic_peer_review_gatekeeping`
*   **Source Gap:** `gap(mountain_coordination_confusion,mountain,rope)`
*   **Question:** Constraint academic_peer_review_gatekeeping appears unchangeable (Mountain) to individuals but optional (Rope) to institutions...
*   **Suggested Resolution Strategy:**
    ```
1. Design measurement protocol for unknown
2. Collect data from N=30+ real-world instances
3. Calculate empirical metrics:
- suppression_requirement (enforcement needed)
- resistance_to_change (pushback level)

*   **Source Gap:** `gap(mountain_coordination_confusion,mountain,rope)`
*   **Question:** Constraint superbowl_advertising_extraction appears unchangeable (Mountain) to individuals but optional (Rope) to institutions...
*   **Suggested Resolution Strategy:**
    ```
1. SAFETY ASSESSMENT (DO NOT SKIP):
- If institutions cut superbowl_advertising_extraction, do individuals have alternatives?
- Is this their only survival mechanism?
- What scaffolding exists for transition?
2. Test institutional perception:
- Can institutions unilaterally change this?
- Do they understand downstream impacts?
- Is their "optional" view empirically accurate?
3. Decision tree:
IF truly unchangeable → Correct institutional view to MOUNTAIN
IF changeable + safe alternatives → Correct powerless view to ROPE
IF changeable + NO alternatives → ADD SCAFFOLD before any change
IF uncertainty → HALT changes until resolved
4. CRITICAL: Never proceed with changes until safety verified

*   **Severity:** `critical`
*   **Associated Constraint:** `gita_kurukshetra`
*   **Source Gap:** `gap(snare_masked_as_rope,snare,rope)`
*   **Question:** Constraint gita_kurukshetra appears extractive (Snare) to individuals but functional (Rope) to institutions...
*   **Suggested Resolution Strategy:**
    ```
1. Map stakeholder perspectives:
- Document how different actors perceive unknown
- Identify source of divergence
2. Gather evidence:
- Empirical metrics (suppression, extraction, resistance)
- Historical behavior patterns
3. Create indexical classification:
- From powerless context: classify as X
- From institutional context: classify as Y
- Add explicit context annotations
    ```
