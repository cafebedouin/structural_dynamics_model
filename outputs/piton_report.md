# Piton Diagnostic Report

**Total Unique Pitons Found:** 4

---

### 1. Piton: `legacy_system_technical_debt`

*   **Claimed Type:** `piton`
*   **Severity:** `N/A`
*   **Perspectival Breakdown:**
*   **Structural Signature Analysis:** N/A
*   **Generated Omega:** N/A
*   **Suggested Resolution Strategy:**
    ```
1. SAFETY ASSESSMENT (DO NOT SKIP):
- If institutions cut legacy_system_technical_debt, do individuals have alternatives?
- Is this their only survival mechanism?
- What scaffolding exists for transition?
2. Test institutional perception:
- Can institutions unilaterally change this?
- Do they understand downstream impacts?
- Is their "optional" view empirically accurate?
3. Decision tree:
IF truly unchangeable → Correct institutional view to MOUNTAIN
IF changeable + safe alternatives → Correct powerless view to ROPE
IF changeable + NO alternatives → ADD SCAFFOLD before any change
IF uncertainty → HALT changes until resolved
4. CRITICAL: Never proceed with changes until safety verified
    ```

### 4. Piton: `regulatory_capture`

*   **Claimed Type:** `piton`
*   **Severity:** `N/A`
*   **Perspectival Breakdown:**
*   **Structural Signature Analysis:** N/A
*   **Generated Omega:** N/A
*   **Suggested Resolution Strategy:**
    ```
1. Interview affected individuals (N=10+):
- Who benefits from regulatory_capture?
- Can you change/exit this constraint?
- What would happen if you tried?
2. Interview institutional actors (N=10+):
- What function does regulatory_capture serve?
- Who would object to removing it?
- What alternatives exist?
3. Document benefit flows:
- Track who gains vs. who loses from status quo
- Measure asymmetric benefit distribution
4. Decision tree:
IF extraction confirmed → Reclassify as NOOSE
IF functional & fair → Reclassify as ROPE
IF context-dependent → Add indexical resolution
    ```
