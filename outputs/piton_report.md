### 1. Piton: `epstein_files_2026`

*   **Claimed Type:** `piton`
*   **Severity:** `N/A`
*   **Perspectival Breakdown:**
*   **Structural Signature Analysis:** N/A
*   **Generated Omega:** N/A
*   **Suggested Resolution Strategy:**
    ```
1. Interview affected individuals (N=10+):
- Who benefits from epstein_files_2026?
- Can you change/exit this constraint?

### 3. Piton: `gold_piton_2026`

*   **Claimed Type:** `piton`
*   **Severity:** `N/A`
*   **Perspectival Breakdown:**
*   **Structural Signature Analysis:** N/A
*   **Generated Omega:** N/A
*   **Suggested Resolution Strategy:**
    ```
1. Map stakeholder perspectives:
- Document how different actors perceive gold_piton_2026
- Identify source of divergence
2. Gather evidence:
- Empirical metrics (suppression, extraction, resistance)
- Historical behavior patterns
3. Create indexical classification:
- From powerless context: classify as X
- From institutional context: classify as Y
- Add explicit context annotations
    ```

### 4. Piton: `juvenile_underclass_2026`

*   **Claimed Type:** `piton`
*   **Severity:** `N/A`
*   **Perspectival Breakdown:**
*   **Structural Signature Analysis:** N/A
*   **Generated Omega:** N/A
*   **Suggested Resolution Strategy:**
    ```
1. SAFETY ASSESSMENT (DO NOT SKIP):
- If institutions cut juvenile_underclass_2026, do individuals have alternatives?
- Is this their only survival mechanism?
- What scaffolding exists for transition?
2. Test institutional perception:
- Can institutions unilaterally change this?
- Do they understand downstream impacts?
- Is their "optional" view empirically accurate?
3. Decision tree:
IF truly unchangeable → Correct institutional view to MOUNTAIN
IF changeable + safe alternatives → Correct powerless view to ROPE
IF changeable + NO alternatives → ADD SCAFFOLD before any change
IF uncertainty → HALT changes until resolved
4. CRITICAL: Never proceed with changes until safety verified
    ```
