  │
  │  HIGH RISK: Coordination Cut Safety
  │  Powerless see: MOUNTAIN (unchangeable, survival-critical)
  │  Institutions see: ROPE (optional, changeable)
  │
  │  RESOLUTION STRATEGY:
  │  1. SAFETY ASSESSMENT (DO NOT SKIP):
  │     - If institutions cut basel_problem_convergence, do individuals have alternatives?
  │     - Is this their only survival mechanism?
  │     - What scaffolding exists for transition?
  │  2. Test institutional perception:
  │     - Can institutions unilaterally change this?
  │     - Do they understand downstream impacts?
  │     - Is their "optional" view empirically accurate?
  │  3. Decision tree:
  │     IF truly unchangeable → Correct institutional view to MOUNTAIN
  │     IF changeable + safe alternatives → Correct powerless view to ROPE
  │     IF changeable + NO alternatives → ADD SCAFFOLD before any change
  │     IF uncertainty → HALT changes until resolved
  │  4. CRITICAL: Never proceed with changes until safety verified

  │  Institutions see: ROPE (optional, changeable)
  │
  │  RESOLUTION STRATEGY:
  │  1. SAFETY ASSESSMENT (DO NOT SKIP):
  │     - If institutions cut carbon_credit_markets_2026, do individuals have alternatives?
  │     - Is this their only survival mechanism?
  │     - What scaffolding exists for transition?
  │  2. Test institutional perception:
  │     - Can institutions unilaterally change this?
  │     - Do they understand downstream impacts?
  │     - Is their "optional" view empirically accurate?
  │  3. Decision tree:
  │     IF truly unchangeable → Correct institutional view to MOUNTAIN
  │     IF changeable + safe alternatives → Correct powerless view to ROPE
  │     IF changeable + NO alternatives → ADD SCAFFOLD before any change
  │     IF uncertainty → HALT changes until resolved

  │     - Document how different actors perceive cognitive_induction_gap
  │     - Identify source of divergence
  │  2. Gather evidence:
  │     - Empirical metrics (suppression, extraction, resistance)
  │     - Historical behavior patterns
  │  3. Create indexical classification:
  │     - From powerless context: classify as X
  │     - From institutional context: classify as Y
  │     - Add explicit context annotations

  │     - Is this their only survival mechanism?
  │     - What scaffolding exists for transition?
  │  2. Test institutional perception:
  │     - Can institutions unilaterally change this?
  │     - Do they understand downstream impacts?
  │     - Is their "optional" view empirically accurate?
  │  3. Decision tree:
  │     IF truly unchangeable → Correct institutional view to MOUNTAIN
  │     IF changeable + safe alternatives → Correct powerless view to ROPE
  │     IF changeable + NO alternatives → ADD SCAFFOLD before any change
  │     IF uncertainty → HALT changes until resolved

  │  3. Decision tree:
  │     IF truly unchangeable → Correct institutional view to MOUNTAIN

  │
  │  RESOLUTION STRATEGY:
  │  1. SAFETY ASSESSMENT (DO NOT SKIP):
  │     - If institutions cut heuristic_optimization, do individuals have alternatives?
  │     - Is this their only survival mechanism?
  │     - What scaffolding exists for transition?
  │  2. Test institutional perception:
  │     - Can institutions unilaterally change this?
  │     - Do they understand downstream impacts?
  │     - Is their "optional" view empirically accurate?
  │  3. Decision tree:
  │     IF truly unchangeable → Correct institutional view to MOUNTAIN
  │     IF changeable + safe alternatives → Correct powerless view to ROPE
  │     IF changeable + NO alternatives → ADD SCAFFOLD before any change
  │     IF uncertainty → HALT changes until resolved

  │     - Is this their only survival mechanism?
  │     - What scaffolding exists for transition?
  │  2. Test institutional perception:
  │     - Can institutions unilaterally change this?
  │     - Do they understand downstream impacts?
  │     - Is their "optional" view empirically accurate?
  │  3. Decision tree:
  │     IF truly unchangeable → Correct institutional view to MOUNTAIN
  │     IF changeable + safe alternatives → Correct powerless view to ROPE

  │     - Do they understand downstream impacts?
  │     - Is their "optional" view empirically accurate?
  │  3. Decision tree:
  │     IF truly unchangeable → Correct institutional view to MOUNTAIN

  │  RESOLUTION STRATEGY:
  │  1. Test changeability:
  │     - Can institutions modify layered_brain_processing?
  │     - What legal/political mechanisms exist?
  │     - Historical precedents of change?
  │  2. Test extraction:
  │     - Is benefit flow symmetric or asymmetric?
  │     - Who has veto power over changes?
  │  3. Decision tree:
  │     IF truly unchangeable + extractive → MANDATROPHY
  │     IF changeable + extractive → Correct to NOOSE
  │     IF unchangeable + fair → Correct to MOUNTAIN
  │     IF institutions falsely claim necessity → NOOSE + fraud flag

  │     - If institutions cut micro_robot_electronics_integration, do individuals have alternatives?
  │     - Is this their only survival mechanism?
  │     - What scaffolding exists for transition?
  │  2. Test institutional perception:
  │     - Can institutions unilaterally change this?
  │     - Do they understand downstream impacts?
  │     - Is their "optional" view empirically accurate?
  │  3. Decision tree:
  │     IF truly unchangeable → Correct institutional view to MOUNTAIN
  │     IF changeable + safe alternatives → Correct powerless view to ROPE
  │     IF changeable + NO alternatives → ADD SCAFFOLD before any change
  │     IF uncertainty → HALT changes until resolved

  │  RESOLUTION STRATEGY:
  │  1. Interview affected individuals (N=10+):
  │     - Who benefits from parkinsons_law?
  │     - Can you change/exit this constraint?
  │     - What would happen if you tried?
  │  2. Interview institutional actors (N=10+):
  │     - What function does parkinsons_law serve?
  │     - Who would object to removing it?
  │     - What alternatives exist?
  │  3. Document benefit flows:
  │     - Track who gains vs. who loses from status quo
  │     - Measure asymmetric benefit distribution
  │  4. Decision tree:
  │     IF extraction confirmed → Reclassify as NOOSE
  │     IF functional & fair → Reclassify as ROPE
  │     IF context-dependent → Add indexical resolution

  │
  │  RESOLUTION STRATEGY:
  │  1. SAFETY ASSESSMENT (DO NOT SKIP):
  │     - If institutions cut reciprocity_laws_math, do individuals have alternatives?
  │     - Is this their only survival mechanism?
  │     - What scaffolding exists for transition?
  │  2. Test institutional perception:
  │     - Can institutions unilaterally change this?
  │     - Do they understand downstream impacts?
  │     - Is their "optional" view empirically accurate?
  │  3. Decision tree:
  │     IF truly unchangeable → Correct institutional view to MOUNTAIN
  │     IF changeable + safe alternatives → Correct powerless view to ROPE
  │     IF changeable + NO alternatives → ADD SCAFFOLD before any change
  │     IF uncertainty → HALT changes until resolved

  │
  │  RESOLUTION STRATEGY:
  │  1. Interview affected individuals (N=10+):
  │     - Who benefits from russian_war_cannibalization?
  │     - Can you change/exit this constraint?
  │     - What would happen if you tried?
  │  2. Interview institutional actors (N=10+):
  │     - What function does russian_war_cannibalization serve?
  │     - Who would object to removing it?
  │     - What alternatives exist?
  │  3. Document benefit flows:
  │     - Track who gains vs. who loses from status quo
  │     - Measure asymmetric benefit distribution
  │  4. Decision tree:
  │     IF extraction confirmed → Reclassify as NOOSE
  │     IF functional & fair → Reclassify as ROPE

  │     - What scaffolding exists for transition?

  │     - Is their "optional" view empirically accurate?
  │  3. Decision tree:
  │     IF truly unchangeable → Correct institutional view to MOUNTAIN

  │     - Is their "optional" view empirically accurate?
  │  3. Decision tree:
  │     IF truly unchangeable → Correct institutional view to MOUNTAIN
  │     IF changeable + safe alternatives → Correct powerless view to ROPE
  │     IF changeable + NO alternatives → ADD SCAFFOLD before any change
  │     IF uncertainty → HALT changes until resolved
  │  4. CRITICAL: Never proceed with changes until safety verified

  │
  │  RESOLUTION STRATEGY:
  │  1. SAFETY ASSESSMENT (DO NOT SKIP):
  │     - If institutions cut udhr_1948, do individuals have alternatives?
  │     - Is this their only survival mechanism?
  │     - What scaffolding exists for transition?
  │  2. Test institutional perception:
  │     - Can institutions unilaterally change this?
  │     - Do they understand downstream impacts?
  │     - Is their "optional" view empirically accurate?
  │  3. Decision tree:
  │     IF truly unchangeable → Correct institutional view to MOUNTAIN
  │     IF changeable + safe alternatives → Correct powerless view to ROPE
  │     IF changeable + NO alternatives → ADD SCAFFOLD before any change
  │     IF uncertainty → HALT changes until resolved

  │     - If institutions cut us_suburban_zoning_2025, do individuals have alternatives?
  │     - Is this their only survival mechanism?
  │     - What scaffolding exists for transition?
  │  2. Test institutional perception:
  │     - Can institutions unilaterally change this?
  │     - Do they understand downstream impacts?
  │     - Is their "optional" view empirically accurate?
  │  3. Decision tree:
  │     IF truly unchangeable → Correct institutional view to MOUNTAIN
  │     IF changeable + safe alternatives → Correct powerless view to ROPE
  │     IF changeable + NO alternatives → ADD SCAFFOLD before any change

  │
  │  CRITICAL: Extraction Masking Detected
  │  Powerless see: NOOSE (extractive trap)

  │
  │  RESOLUTION STRATEGY:
  │  1. Interview affected individuals (N=10+):
  │     - Who benefits from zipfs_law?
  │     - Can you change/exit this constraint?
  │     - What would happen if you tried?
  │  2. Interview institutional actors (N=10+):
  │     - What function does zipfs_law serve?
  │     - Who would object to removing it?
  │     - What alternatives exist?
  │  3. Document benefit flows:
  │     - Track who gains vs. who loses from status quo
  │     - Measure asymmetric benefit distribution
  │  4. Decision tree:
  │     IF extraction confirmed → Reclassify as NOOSE
  │     IF functional & fair → Reclassify as ROPE
  │     IF context-dependent → Add indexical resolution
