  │     - Is this their only survival mechanism?
  │     - What scaffolding exists for transition?

  │     - Do they understand downstream impacts?
  │     - Is their "optional" view empirically accurate?
  │  3. Decision tree:
  │     IF truly unchangeable → Correct institutional view to MOUNTAIN

  │     - Is this their only survival mechanism?
  │     - What scaffolding exists for transition?
  │  2. Test institutional perception:
  │     - Can institutions unilaterally change this?
  │     - Do they understand downstream impacts?
  │     - Is their "optional" view empirically accurate?
  │  3. Decision tree:
  │     IF truly unchangeable → Correct institutional view to MOUNTAIN
  │     IF changeable + safe alternatives → Correct powerless view to ROPE
  │     IF changeable + NO alternatives → ADD SCAFFOLD before any change
  │     IF uncertainty → HALT changes until resolved

  │
  │  RESOLUTION STRATEGY:
  │  1. SAFETY ASSESSMENT (DO NOT SKIP):
  │     - If institutions cut axiom_of_choice_determinacy, do individuals have alternatives?
  │     - Is this their only survival mechanism?
  │     - What scaffolding exists for transition?
  │  2. Test institutional perception:
  │     - Can institutions unilaterally change this?
  │     - Do they understand downstream impacts?
  │     - Is their "optional" view empirically accurate?
  │  3. Decision tree:
  │     IF truly unchangeable → Correct institutional view to MOUNTAIN
  │     IF changeable + safe alternatives → Correct powerless view to ROPE
  │     IF changeable + NO alternatives → ADD SCAFFOLD before any change
  │     IF uncertainty → HALT changes until resolved

  │
  │  RESOLUTION STRATEGY:
  │  1. SAFETY ASSESSMENT (DO NOT SKIP):
  │     - If institutions cut banach_tarski_paradox, do individuals have alternatives?
  │     - Is this their only survival mechanism?
  │     - What scaffolding exists for transition?
  │  2. Test institutional perception:
  │     - Can institutions unilaterally change this?
  │     - Do they understand downstream impacts?
  │     - Is their "optional" view empirically accurate?
  │  3. Decision tree:
  │     IF truly unchangeable → Correct institutional view to MOUNTAIN
  │     IF changeable + safe alternatives → Correct powerless view to ROPE
  │     IF changeable + NO alternatives → ADD SCAFFOLD before any change
  │     IF uncertainty → HALT changes until resolved

  │
  │  RESOLUTION STRATEGY:
  │  1. SAFETY ASSESSMENT (DO NOT SKIP):
  │     - If institutions cut birthday_paradox_collision, do individuals have alternatives?
  │     - Is this their only survival mechanism?
  │     - What scaffolding exists for transition?
  │  2. Test institutional perception:
  │     - Can institutions unilaterally change this?
  │     - Do they understand downstream impacts?
  │     - Is their "optional" view empirically accurate?
  │  3. Decision tree:
  │     IF truly unchangeable → Correct institutional view to MOUNTAIN
  │     IF changeable + safe alternatives → Correct powerless view to ROPE
  │     IF changeable + NO alternatives → ADD SCAFFOLD before any change
  │     IF uncertainty → HALT changes until resolved

  │     - What scaffolding exists for transition?

  │
  │  HIGH RISK: Coordination Cut Safety
  │  Powerless see: MOUNTAIN (unchangeable, survival-critical)
  │  Institutions see: ROPE (optional, changeable)
  │
  │  RESOLUTION STRATEGY:
  │  1. SAFETY ASSESSMENT (DO NOT SKIP):
  │     - If institutions cut chaitins_omega_undecidability, do individuals have alternatives?
  │     - Is this their only survival mechanism?
  │     - What scaffolding exists for transition?
  │  2. Test institutional perception:
  │     - Can institutions unilaterally change this?
  │     - Do they understand downstream impacts?
  │     - Is their "optional" view empirically accurate?
  │  3. Decision tree:
  │     IF truly unchangeable → Correct institutional view to MOUNTAIN
  │     IF changeable + safe alternatives → Correct powerless view to ROPE
  │     IF changeable + NO alternatives → ADD SCAFFOLD before any change
  │     IF uncertainty → HALT changes until resolved
  │  4. CRITICAL: Never proceed with changes until safety verified

  │
  │  HIGH RISK: Coordination Cut Safety
  │  Powerless see: MOUNTAIN (unchangeable, survival-critical)
  │  Institutions see: ROPE (optional, changeable)
  │
  │  RESOLUTION STRATEGY:
  │  1. SAFETY ASSESSMENT (DO NOT SKIP):
  │     - If institutions cut climate_attribution_2026, do individuals have alternatives?
  │     - Is this their only survival mechanism?
  │     - What scaffolding exists for transition?
  │  2. Test institutional perception:
  │     - Can institutions unilaterally change this?
  │     - Do they understand downstream impacts?
  │     - Is their "optional" view empirically accurate?
  │  3. Decision tree:
  │     IF truly unchangeable → Correct institutional view to MOUNTAIN
  │     IF changeable + safe alternatives → Correct powerless view to ROPE
  │     IF changeable + NO alternatives → ADD SCAFFOLD before any change
  │     IF uncertainty → HALT changes until resolved
  │  4. CRITICAL: Never proceed with changes until safety verified

  │     - Is this their only survival mechanism?
  │     - What scaffolding exists for transition?
  │  2. Test institutional perception:

  │     - Do they understand downstream impacts?
  │     - Is their "optional" view empirically accurate?
  │  3. Decision tree:
  │     IF truly unchangeable → Correct institutional view to MOUNTAIN

  │     - Who would object to removing it?
  │     - What alternatives exist?
  │  3. Document benefit flows:
  │     - Track who gains vs. who loses from status quo

  │     - Is this their only survival mechanism?
  │     - What scaffolding exists for transition?
  │  2. Test institutional perception:
  │     - Can institutions unilaterally change this?
  │     - Do they understand downstream impacts?
  │     - Is their "optional" view empirically accurate?
  │  3. Decision tree:
  │     IF truly unchangeable → Correct institutional view to MOUNTAIN
  │     IF changeable + safe alternatives → Correct powerless view to ROPE

  │
  │  RESOLUTION STRATEGY:
  │  1. SAFETY ASSESSMENT (DO NOT SKIP):
  │     - If institutions cut finite_simple_group_classification, do individuals have alternatives?
  │     - Is this their only survival mechanism?
  │     - What scaffolding exists for transition?
  │  2. Test institutional perception:
  │     - Can institutions unilaterally change this?
  │     - Do they understand downstream impacts?
  │     - Is their "optional" view empirically accurate?
  │  3. Decision tree:
  │     IF truly unchangeable → Correct institutional view to MOUNTAIN
  │     IF changeable + safe alternatives → Correct powerless view to ROPE
  │     IF changeable + NO alternatives → ADD SCAFFOLD before any change
  │     IF uncertainty → HALT changes until resolved

  │
  │  HIGH RISK: Coordination Cut Safety
  │  Powerless see: MOUNTAIN (unchangeable, survival-critical)
  │  Institutions see: ROPE (optional, changeable)
  │
  │  RESOLUTION STRATEGY:
  │  1. SAFETY ASSESSMENT (DO NOT SKIP):
  │     - If institutions cut indexical_relativity_core, do individuals have alternatives?
  │     - Is this their only survival mechanism?
  │     - What scaffolding exists for transition?
  │  2. Test institutional perception:
  │     - Can institutions unilaterally change this?
  │     - Do they understand downstream impacts?
  │     - Is their "optional" view empirically accurate?
  │  3. Decision tree:
  │     IF truly unchangeable → Correct institutional view to MOUNTAIN
  │     IF changeable + safe alternatives → Correct powerless view to ROPE
  │     IF changeable + NO alternatives → ADD SCAFFOLD before any change
  │     IF uncertainty → HALT changes until resolved
  │  4. CRITICAL: Never proceed with changes until safety verified

  │     - Can you change/exit this constraint?
  │     - What would happen if you tried?
  │  2. Interview institutional actors (N=10+):

  │     - Who would object to removing it?
  │     - What alternatives exist?
  │  3. Document benefit flows:
  │     - Track who gains vs. who loses from status quo
  │     - Measure asymmetric benefit distribution
  │  4. Decision tree:
  │     IF extraction confirmed → Reclassify as SNARE
  │     IF functional & fair → Reclassify as ROPE

  │     - Is this their only survival mechanism?
  │     - What scaffolding exists for transition?
  │  2. Test institutional perception:

  │     - Do they understand downstream impacts?
  │     - Is their "optional" view empirically accurate?
  │  3. Decision tree:
  │     IF truly unchangeable → Correct institutional view to MOUNTAIN
  │     IF changeable + safe alternatives → Correct powerless view to ROPE

  │
  │  RESOLUTION STRATEGY:
  │  1. SAFETY ASSESSMENT (DO NOT SKIP):
  │     - If institutions cut max_flow_min_cut, do individuals have alternatives?
  │     - Is this their only survival mechanism?
  │     - What scaffolding exists for transition?
  │  2. Test institutional perception:
  │     - Can institutions unilaterally change this?
  │     - Do they understand downstream impacts?
  │     - Is their "optional" view empirically accurate?
  │  3. Decision tree:
  │     IF truly unchangeable → Correct institutional view to MOUNTAIN
  │     IF changeable + safe alternatives → Correct powerless view to ROPE
  │     IF changeable + NO alternatives → ADD SCAFFOLD before any change
  │     IF uncertainty → HALT changes until resolved

  │  Constraint: nonstandard_arithmetic_models

  │
  │  HIGH RISK: Coordination Cut Safety
  │  Powerless see: MOUNTAIN (unchangeable, survival-critical)
  │  Institutions see: ROPE (optional, changeable)
  │
  │  RESOLUTION STRATEGY:
  │  1. SAFETY ASSESSMENT (DO NOT SKIP):
  │     - If institutions cut nonstandard_arithmetic_models, do individuals have alternatives?
  │     - Is this their only survival mechanism?
  │     - What scaffolding exists for transition?
  │  2. Test institutional perception:
  │     - Can institutions unilaterally change this?
  │     - Do they understand downstream impacts?
  │     - Is their "optional" view empirically accurate?
  │  3. Decision tree:
  │     IF truly unchangeable → Correct institutional view to MOUNTAIN
  │     IF changeable + safe alternatives → Correct powerless view to ROPE
  │     IF changeable + NO alternatives → ADD SCAFFOLD before any change
  │     IF uncertainty → HALT changes until resolved
  │  4. CRITICAL: Never proceed with changes until safety verified

  │
  │  RESOLUTION STRATEGY:
  │  1. SAFETY ASSESSMENT (DO NOT SKIP):
  │     - If institutions cut permissive_software_licensing, do individuals have alternatives?
  │     - Is this their only survival mechanism?
  │     - What scaffolding exists for transition?
  │  2. Test institutional perception:
  │     - Can institutions unilaterally change this?
  │     - Do they understand downstream impacts?
  │     - Is their "optional" view empirically accurate?
  │  3. Decision tree:
  │     IF truly unchangeable → Correct institutional view to MOUNTAIN
  │     IF changeable + safe alternatives → Correct powerless view to ROPE
  │     IF changeable + NO alternatives → ADD SCAFFOLD before any change
  │     IF uncertainty → HALT changes until resolved

  │  RESOLUTION STRATEGY:

  │     - If institutions cut poincare_conjecture, do individuals have alternatives?
  │     - Is this their only survival mechanism?
  │     - What scaffolding exists for transition?
  │  2. Test institutional perception:
  │     - Can institutions unilaterally change this?
  │     - Do they understand downstream impacts?
  │     - Is their "optional" view empirically accurate?
  │  3. Decision tree:
  │     IF truly unchangeable → Correct institutional view to MOUNTAIN
  │     IF changeable + safe alternatives → Correct powerless view to ROPE
  │     IF changeable + NO alternatives → ADD SCAFFOLD before any change
  │     IF uncertainty → HALT changes until resolved

  │
  │  RESOLUTION STRATEGY:
  │  1. SAFETY ASSESSMENT (DO NOT SKIP):
  │     - If institutions cut prime_number_theorem, do individuals have alternatives?
  │     - Is this their only survival mechanism?
  │     - What scaffolding exists for transition?
  │  2. Test institutional perception:
  │     - Can institutions unilaterally change this?
  │     - Do they understand downstream impacts?
  │     - Is their "optional" view empirically accurate?
  │  3. Decision tree:
  │     IF truly unchangeable → Correct institutional view to MOUNTAIN
  │     IF changeable + safe alternatives → Correct powerless view to ROPE
  │     IF changeable + NO alternatives → ADD SCAFFOLD before any change
  │     IF uncertainty → HALT changes until resolved

  │
  │  RESOLUTION STRATEGY:
  │  1. SAFETY ASSESSMENT (DO NOT SKIP):
  │     - If institutions cut proof_of_work_consensus, do individuals have alternatives?
  │     - Is this their only survival mechanism?
  │     - What scaffolding exists for transition?
  │  2. Test institutional perception:
  │     - Can institutions unilaterally change this?
  │     - Do they understand downstream impacts?
  │     - Is their "optional" view empirically accurate?
  │  3. Decision tree:
  │     IF truly unchangeable → Correct institutional view to MOUNTAIN
  │     IF changeable + safe alternatives → Correct powerless view to ROPE
  │     IF changeable + NO alternatives → ADD SCAFFOLD before any change
  │     IF uncertainty → HALT changes until resolved
  │  4. CRITICAL: Never proceed with changes until safety verified

  │
  │  RESOLUTION STRATEGY:
  │  1. SAFETY ASSESSMENT (DO NOT SKIP):
  │     - If institutions cut quantum_entanglement_protocol, do individuals have alternatives?
  │     - Is this their only survival mechanism?
  │     - What scaffolding exists for transition?
  │  2. Test institutional perception:
  │     - Can institutions unilaterally change this?
  │     - Do they understand downstream impacts?
  │     - Is their "optional" view empirically accurate?
  │  3. Decision tree:
  │     IF truly unchangeable → Correct institutional view to MOUNTAIN
  │     IF changeable + safe alternatives → Correct powerless view to ROPE
  │     IF changeable + NO alternatives → ADD SCAFFOLD before any change
  │     IF uncertainty → HALT changes until resolved

  │
  │  HIGH RISK: Coordination Cut Safety
  │  Powerless see: MOUNTAIN (unchangeable, survival-critical)
  │  Institutions see: ROPE (optional, changeable)
  │
  │  RESOLUTION STRATEGY:
  │  1. SAFETY ASSESSMENT (DO NOT SKIP):
  │     - If institutions cut quine_self_replication, do individuals have alternatives?
  │     - Is this their only survival mechanism?
  │     - What scaffolding exists for transition?
  │  2. Test institutional perception:
  │     - Can institutions unilaterally change this?
  │     - Do they understand downstream impacts?
  │     - Is their "optional" view empirically accurate?
  │  3. Decision tree:
  │     IF truly unchangeable → Correct institutional view to MOUNTAIN
  │     IF changeable + safe alternatives → Correct powerless view to ROPE
  │     IF changeable + NO alternatives → ADD SCAFFOLD before any change
  │     IF uncertainty → HALT changes until resolved
  │  4. CRITICAL: Never proceed with changes until safety verified

  │
  │  HIGH RISK: Coordination Cut Safety
  │  Powerless see: MOUNTAIN (unchangeable, survival-critical)
  │  Institutions see: ROPE (optional, changeable)
  │
  │  RESOLUTION STRATEGY:
  │  1. SAFETY ASSESSMENT (DO NOT SKIP):
  │     - If institutions cut reciprocity_laws_math, do individuals have alternatives?
  │     - Is this their only survival mechanism?
  │     - What scaffolding exists for transition?
  │  2. Test institutional perception:
  │     - Can institutions unilaterally change this?
  │     - Do they understand downstream impacts?
  │     - Is their "optional" view empirically accurate?
  │  3. Decision tree:
  │     IF truly unchangeable → Correct institutional view to MOUNTAIN
  │     IF changeable + safe alternatives → Correct powerless view to ROPE
  │     IF changeable + NO alternatives → ADD SCAFFOLD before any change
  │     IF uncertainty → HALT changes until resolved
  │  4. CRITICAL: Never proceed with changes until safety verified

  │     - If institutions cut sadhu_integrity_protocol, do individuals have alternatives?
  │     - Is this their only survival mechanism?
  │     - What scaffolding exists for transition?
  │  2. Test institutional perception:
  │     - Can institutions unilaterally change this?
  │     - Do they understand downstream impacts?
  │     - Is their "optional" view empirically accurate?
  │  3. Decision tree:
  │     IF truly unchangeable → Correct institutional view to MOUNTAIN
  │     IF changeable + safe alternatives → Correct powerless view to ROPE
  │     IF changeable + NO alternatives → ADD SCAFFOLD before any change
  │     IF uncertainty → HALT changes until resolved

  │     - Is their "optional" view empirically accurate?
  │  3. Decision tree:

  │     - If institutions cut unclos_2026, do individuals have alternatives?
  │     - Is this their only survival mechanism?
  │     - What scaffolding exists for transition?
  │  2. Test institutional perception:
  │     - Can institutions unilaterally change this?
  │     - Do they understand downstream impacts?
  │     - Is their "optional" view empirically accurate?
  │  3. Decision tree:
  │     IF truly unchangeable → Correct institutional view to MOUNTAIN
  │     IF changeable + safe alternatives → Correct powerless view to ROPE
  │     IF changeable + NO alternatives → ADD SCAFFOLD before any change
  │     IF uncertainty → HALT changes until resolved

  │  HIGH RISK: Coordination Cut Safety
  │  Powerless see: MOUNTAIN (unchangeable, survival-critical)
  │  Institutions see: ROPE (optional, changeable)
  │
  │  RESOLUTION STRATEGY:
  │  1. SAFETY ASSESSMENT (DO NOT SKIP):
  │     - If institutions cut whitehead_problem_undecidability, do individuals have alternatives?
  │     - Is this their only survival mechanism?
  │     - What scaffolding exists for transition?
  │  2. Test institutional perception:
  │     - Can institutions unilaterally change this?
  │     - Do they understand downstream impacts?
  │     - Is their "optional" view empirically accurate?
  │  3. Decision tree:
  │     IF truly unchangeable → Correct institutional view to MOUNTAIN
  │     IF changeable + safe alternatives → Correct powerless view to ROPE
  │     IF changeable + NO alternatives → ADD SCAFFOLD before any change
  │     IF uncertainty → HALT changes until resolved
  │  4. CRITICAL: Never proceed with changes until safety verified

  │  Institutions see: ROPE (functional rule)
  │
  │  RESOLUTION STRATEGY:
  │  1. Interview affected individuals (N=10+):
  │     - Who benefits from zombie_reasoning_2026?
  │     - Can you change/exit this constraint?
  │     - What would happen if you tried?
  │  2. Interview institutional actors (N=10+):
  │     - What function does zombie_reasoning_2026 serve?
  │     - Who would object to removing it?
  │     - What alternatives exist?
  │  3. Document benefit flows:
  │     - Track who gains vs. who loses from status quo
  │     - Measure asymmetric benefit distribution
  │  4. Decision tree:
  │     IF extraction confirmed → Reclassify as SNARE
  │     IF functional & fair → Reclassify as ROPE
  │     IF context-dependent → Add indexical resolution
