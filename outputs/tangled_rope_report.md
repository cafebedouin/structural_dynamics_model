### 1. Tangled Rope: `26usc469`

*   **Claimed Type:** `snare`
*   **Severity:** `N/A`
*   **Perspectival Breakdown:**
    *   Individual (Powerless) View: `snare`
    *   Institutional (Manager) View: `rope`
    *   Analytical View: `tangled_rope`
*   **Structural Signature Analysis:** CONSTRUCTED CONSTRAINT signature for 26usc469: Active enforcement detected (suppression=0.50, resistance=0.50) with 0 asymmetric beneficiaries. This is an institutionally maintained rule requiring ongoing suppression energy.
*   **Related Gap/Alert:** ! ALERT: Extractive "Snare" is masked as functional "Rope".
*   **Generated Omega:** Constraint 26usc469 appears extractive (Snare) to individuals but functional (Rope) to institutions...
*   **Suggested Resolution Strategy:**
    ```
1. Interview affected individuals (N=10+):
- Who benefits from 26usc469?
- Can you change/exit this constraint?
- What would happen if you tried?
2. Interview institutional actors (N=10+):
- What function does 26usc469 serve?
- Who would object to removing it?
- What alternatives exist?
3. Document benefit flows:
- Track who gains vs. who loses from status quo
- Measure asymmetric benefit distribution
4. Decision tree:
IF extraction confirmed → Reclassify as NOOSE
IF functional & fair → Reclassify as ROPE
IF context-dependent → Add indexical resolution
    ```

### 24. Tangled Rope: `sts86_ascent_checklist`

*   **Claimed Type:** `mountain`
*   **Severity:** `N/A`
*   **Perspectival Breakdown:**
    *   Individual (Powerless) View: `mountain`
    *   Institutional (Manager) View: `rope`
    *   Analytical View: `N/A`
*   **Structural Signature Analysis:** CONSTRUCTED CONSTRAINT signature for sts86_ascent_checklist: Active enforcement detected (suppression=0.50, resistance=0.50) with 0 asymmetric beneficiaries. This is an institutionally maintained rule requiring ongoing suppression energy.
*   **Related Gap/Alert:** ! GAP: Institutional "Rope" appears as "Mountain" to Powerless.
*   **Generated Omega:** Constraint sts86_ascent_checklist appears unchangeable (Mountain) to individuals but optional (Rope) to institutions...
*   **Suggested Resolution Strategy:**
    ```
1. SAFETY ASSESSMENT (DO NOT SKIP):
- If institutions cut sts86_ascent_checklist, do individuals have alternatives?
- Is this their only survival mechanism?
- What scaffolding exists for transition?
2. Test institutional perception:
- Can institutions unilaterally change this?
- Do they understand downstream impacts?
- Is their "optional" view empirically accurate?
3. Decision tree:
IF truly unchangeable → Correct institutional view to MOUNTAIN
IF changeable + safe alternatives → Correct powerless view to ROPE
IF changeable + NO alternatives → ADD SCAFFOLD before any change
IF uncertainty → HALT changes until resolved
4. CRITICAL: Never proceed with changes until safety verified

### 25. Tangled Rope: `suanne_face_restoration`

*   **Claimed Type:** `snare`
*   **Severity:** `N/A`
*   **Perspectival Breakdown:**
    *   Individual (Powerless) View: `snare`
    *   Institutional (Manager) View: `tangled_rope`
    *   Analytical View: `N/A`
*   **Structural Signature Analysis:** CONSTRUCTED CONSTRAINT signature for suanne_face_restoration: Active enforcement detected (suppression=0.50, resistance=0.50) with 0 asymmetric beneficiaries. This is an institutionally maintained rule requiring ongoing suppression energy.
*   **Related Gap/Alert:** N/A
*   **Generated Omega:** Constraint suanne_face_restoration appears as snare to individuals but tangled_rope to institutions...
*   **Suggested Resolution Strategy:**
    ```
1. Map stakeholder perspectives:
- Document how different actors perceive suanne_face_restoration
- Identify source of divergence
2. Gather evidence:
- Empirical metrics (suppression, extraction, resistance)
- Historical behavior patterns
3. Create indexical classification:
- From powerless context: classify as X
- From institutional context: classify as Y
- Add explicit context annotations
    ```
