### 1. Tangled Rope: `26usc469_real_estate_exemption`

*   **Claimed Type:** `tangled_rope`
*   **Severity:** `N/A`
*   **Perspectival Breakdown:**
    *   Individual (Powerless) View: `snare`
    *   Institutional (Manager) View: `rope`
    *   Analytical View: `N/A`
*   **Structural Signature Analysis:** FALSE CI_ROPE signature for 26usc469_real_estate_exemption: Appears to be rope (indexed_rope_classification) but fails 3 Boltzmann structural test(s): [boltzmann_non_compliant(1.0,0.25),excess_above_floor(0.7),nonsensical_coupling(0.3333333333333333)]. Coupling score=1.0. This constraint is "coordination-washed" — it hides extraction behind low metrics, distributed enforcement, or behavioral defaults.
*   **Related Gap/Alert:** ! ALERT: Extractive "Snare" is masked as functional "Rope".
*   **Generated Omega:** Constraint 26usc469_real_estate_exemption appears extractive (Snare) to individuals but functional (Rope) to institutions...
*   **Suggested Resolution Strategy:**
    ```
1. Interview affected individuals (N=10+):
- Who benefits from 26usc469_real_estate_exemption?
- Can you change/exit this constraint?
- What would happen if you tried?
2. Interview institutional actors (N=10+):
- What function does 26usc469_real_estate_exemption serve?
- Who would object to removing it?
- What alternatives exist?
3. Document benefit flows:
- Track who gains vs. who loses from status quo
- Measure asymmetric benefit distribution
4. Decision tree:
IF extraction confirmed → Reclassify as SNARE
IF functional & fair → Reclassify as ROPE
IF context-dependent → Add indexical resolution
    ```
