    *   Institutional (Manager) View: `rope`
    *   Analytical View: `N/A`
*   **Structural Signature Analysis:** FALSE CI_ROPE signature for 26usc469_real_estate_exemption: Appears to be rope (indexed_rope_classification) but fails 2 Boltzmann structural test(s): [boltzmann_non_compliant(0.75,0.25),excess_above_floor(0.7)]. Coupling score=0.75. This constraint is "coordination-washed" — it hides extraction behind low metrics, distributed enforcement, or behavioral defaults.
*   **Related Gap/Alert:** ! ALERT: Extractive "Snare" is masked as functional "Rope".
*   **Generated Omega:** Constraint 26usc469_real_estate_exemption appears extractive (Snare) to individuals but functional (Rope) to institutions...
*   **Suggested Resolution Strategy:**
    ```
1. Interview affected individuals (N=10+):

- Measure asymmetric benefit distribution
4. Decision tree:
IF extraction confirmed → Reclassify as SNARE
IF functional & fair → Reclassify as ROPE

### 20. Tangled Rope: `ai_task_horizon_reliability`

*   **Claimed Type:** `tangled_rope`

*   **Perspectival Breakdown:**
    *   Individual (Powerless) View: `mountain`
    *   Institutional (Manager) View: `rope`
    *   Analytical View: `tangled_rope`
*   **Structural Signature Analysis:** Perspectives AGREE
*   **Related Gap/Alert:** ! GAP: Institutional "Rope" appears as "Mountain" to Powerless.
*   **Generated Omega:** Constraint ai_task_horizon_reliability appears unchangeable (Mountain) to individuals but optional (Rope) to institutions...
*   **Suggested Resolution Strategy:**
    ```
1. SAFETY ASSESSMENT (DO NOT SKIP):
- If institutions cut ai_task_horizon_reliability, do individuals have alternatives?
- Is this their only survival mechanism?
- What scaffolding exists for transition?
2. Test institutional perception:
- Can institutions unilaterally change this?
- Do they understand downstream impacts?
- Is their "optional" view empirically accurate?
3. Decision tree:
IF truly unchangeable → Correct institutional view to MOUNTAIN
IF changeable + safe alternatives → Correct powerless view to ROPE
IF changeable + NO alternatives → ADD SCAFFOLD before any change
IF uncertainty → HALT changes until resolved
4. CRITICAL: Never proceed with changes until safety verified

### 62. Tangled Rope: `climate_target_one_point_five`

*   **Claimed Type:** `tangled_rope`

*   **Perspectival Breakdown:**
    *   Individual (Powerless) View: `mountain`
    *   Institutional (Manager) View: `snare`
    *   Analytical View: `N/A`
*   **Structural Signature Analysis:** FALSE NATURAL LAW signature for climate_target_one_point_five: Claims naturality (indexed_mountain_classification) but fails Boltzmann independence test. Coupling score=1.000 with 6 coupled dimension pairs. Excess extraction=0.25. This constraint is "physics-washed" — it appears natural but its coupling topology reveals structural construction.
*   **Related Gap/Alert:** N/A
*   **Generated Omega:** Constraint climate_target_one_point_five appears as mountain to individuals but snare to institutions...
*   **Suggested Resolution Strategy:**
    ```
1. Map stakeholder perspectives:
- Document how different actors perceive climate_target_one_point_five
- Identify source of divergence
2. Gather evidence:
- Empirical metrics (suppression, extraction, resistance)
- Historical behavior patterns
3. Create indexical classification:
- From powerless context: classify as X
- From institutional context: classify as Y
- Add explicit context annotations
    ```

- Is this their only survival mechanism?
- What scaffolding exists for transition?

- Can institutions unilaterally change this?
- Do they understand downstream impacts?
- Is their "optional" view empirically accurate?
3. Decision tree:
IF truly unchangeable → Correct institutional view to MOUNTAIN
IF changeable + safe alternatives → Correct powerless view to ROPE
IF changeable + NO alternatives → ADD SCAFFOLD before any change
IF uncertainty → HALT changes until resolved

*   **Suggested Resolution Strategy:**
    ```
1. SAFETY ASSESSMENT (DO NOT SKIP):
- If institutions cut self_surpassing, do individuals have alternatives?
- Is this their only survival mechanism?
- What scaffolding exists for transition?
2. Test institutional perception:
- Can institutions unilaterally change this?
- Do they understand downstream impacts?
- Is their "optional" view empirically accurate?
3. Decision tree:
IF truly unchangeable → Correct institutional view to MOUNTAIN
IF changeable + safe alternatives → Correct powerless view to ROPE
IF changeable + NO alternatives → ADD SCAFFOLD before any change
IF uncertainty → HALT changes until resolved
4. CRITICAL: Never proceed with changes until safety verified

*   **Suggested Resolution Strategy:**
    ```
1. Interview affected individuals (N=10+):
- Who benefits from value_alignment_drift?
- Can you change/exit this constraint?
- What would happen if you tried?
2. Interview institutional actors (N=10+):
- What function does value_alignment_drift serve?
- Who would object to removing it?
- What alternatives exist?
3. Document benefit flows:
- Track who gains vs. who loses from status quo
- Measure asymmetric benefit distribution
4. Decision tree:
IF extraction confirmed → Reclassify as SNARE
IF functional & fair → Reclassify as ROPE
IF context-dependent → Add indexical resolution
    ```

### 388. Tangled Rope: `value_extraction_plateau`

*   **Claimed Type:** `tangled_rope`
*   **Severity:** `N/A`
*   **Perspectival Breakdown:**
    *   Individual (Powerless) View: `snare`
    *   Institutional (Manager) View: `rope`
    *   Analytical View: `piton`
*   **Structural Signature Analysis:** Perspectives AGREE
*   **Related Gap/Alert:** ! ALERT: Extractive "Snare" is masked as functional "Rope".
*   **Generated Omega:** Constraint value_extraction_plateau appears extractive (Snare) to individuals but functional (Rope) to institutions...
*   **Suggested Resolution Strategy:**

### 389. Tangled Rope: `visibility_bias_governance`

*   **Claimed Type:** `tangled_rope`

*   **Perspectival Breakdown:**
    *   Individual (Powerless) View: `snare`
    *   Institutional (Manager) View: `rope`
    *   Analytical View: `tangled_rope`
*   **Structural Signature Analysis:** FALSE CI_ROPE signature for visibility_bias_governance: Appears to be rope (indexed_rope_classification) but fails 4 Boltzmann structural test(s): [boltzmann_non_compliant(1.0,0.25),scope_variant([snare,tangled_rope]),excess_above_floor(0.49000000000000005),nonsensical_coupling(0.5)]. Coupling score=1.0. This constraint is "coordination-washed" — it hides extraction behind low metrics, distributed enforcement, or behavioral defaults.
