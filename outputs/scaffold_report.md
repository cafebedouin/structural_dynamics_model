### 1. Scaffold: `coffee_cardiovascular_2026`

*   **Claimed Type:** `scaffold`
*   **Severity:** `N/A`
*   **Perspectival Breakdown:**
*   **Structural Signature Analysis:** CONSTRUCTED LOW-EXTRACTION signature for coffee_cardiovascular_2026: Enforcement present (suppression=0.40, resistance=0.50) but extraction is low (0.12). This is a rule-based coordination structure, not an extraction mechanism.
