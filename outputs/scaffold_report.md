### 1. Scaffold: `alternative_sovereignty_scaffold`

*   **Claimed Type:** `scaffold`
*   **Severity:** `N/A`
*   **Perspectival Breakdown:**
*   **Structural Signature Analysis:** FALSE CI_ROPE signature for alternative_sovereignty_scaffold: Appears to be rope (indexed_rope_classification) but fails 3 Boltzmann structural test(s): [boltzmann_non_compliant(0.75,0.4),scope_variant([rope,scaffold]),nonsensical_coupling(0.3333333333333333)]. Coupling score=0.75. This constraint is "coordination-washed" — it hides extraction behind low metrics, distributed enforcement, or behavioral defaults.

*   **Claimed Type:** `scaffold`
*   **Severity:** `N/A`
*   **Perspectival Breakdown:**

Coupling score=0. This constraint is "coordination-washed" — it hides extraction behind low metrics, distributed enforcement, or behavioral defaults.
