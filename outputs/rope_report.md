### 1. Rope: `ai_edu_decentralization`

*   **Claimed Type:** `rope`
*   **Structural Signature Analysis:** CONSTRUCTED HIGH-EXTRACTION signature for ai_edu_decentralization: Enforcement present (suppression=0.40, resistance=0.50) with high extraction (0.50). This is an extraction mechanism that metrics failed to classify as snare.
*   **Perspectival Agreement:** Confirmed. All tested perspectives agree on the 'rope' classification.
*   **Suggested Resolution Strategy:**
    ```
1. Design measurement protocol for unknown
2. Collect data from N=30+ real-world instances
3. Calculate empirical metrics:
- suppression_requirement (enforcement needed)
- resistance_to_change (pushback level)
- base_extractiveness (asymmetric benefit flow)
4. Update constraint_metric/3 declarations with data
5. Re-run classification to resolve perspectival gap
    ```

*   **Generated Omega:** Constraint deferential_realism_framework appears unchangeable (Mountain) to individuals but optional (Rope) to institutions...
*   **Suggested Resolution Strategy:**
    ```
1. SAFETY ASSESSMENT (DO NOT SKIP):
- If institutions cut deferential_realism_framework, do individuals have alternatives?
- Is this their only survival mechanism?
- What scaffolding exists for transition?
2. Test institutional perception:
- Can institutions unilaterally change this?
- Do they understand downstream impacts?
- Is their "optional" view empirically accurate?
3. Decision tree:
IF truly unchangeable → Correct institutional view to MOUNTAIN
IF changeable + safe alternatives → Correct powerless view to ROPE
IF changeable + NO alternatives → ADD SCAFFOLD before any change
IF uncertainty → HALT changes until resolved
4. CRITICAL: Never proceed with changes until safety verified
    ```
