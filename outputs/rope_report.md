### 1. Rope: `adverse_possession`

*   **Claimed Type:** `rope`
*   **Structural Signature Analysis:** CONSTRUCTED CONSTRAINT signature for adverse_possession: Active enforcement detected (suppression=0.40, resistance=0.50) with 0 asymmetric beneficiaries. This is an institutionally maintained rule requiring ongoing suppression energy.
*   **Perspectival Agreement:** Confirmed. All tested perspectives agree on the 'rope' classification.
*   **Related Gap/Alert:** ! ALERT: Extractive "Snare" is masked as functional "Rope".
*   **Generated Omega:** Constraint adverse_possession appears extractive (Snare) to individuals but functional (Rope) to institutions...
*   **Suggested Resolution Strategy:**
    ```
1. Interview affected individuals (N=10+):
- Who benefits from adverse_possession?
- Can you change/exit this constraint?
- What would happen if you tried?
2. Interview institutional actors (N=10+):
- What function does adverse_possession serve?
- Who would object to removing it?
- What alternatives exist?
3. Document benefit flows:
- Track who gains vs. who loses from status quo
- Measure asymmetric benefit distribution
4. Decision tree:
IF extraction confirmed → Reclassify as NOOSE
IF functional & fair → Reclassify as ROPE
IF context-dependent → Add indexical resolution
    ```

*   **Generated Omega:** Constraint carbon_credit_markets_2026 appears unchangeable (Mountain) to individuals but optional (Rope) to institutions...
*   **Suggested Resolution Strategy:**
    ```
1. SAFETY ASSESSMENT (DO NOT SKIP):
- If institutions cut carbon_credit_markets_2026, do individuals have alternatives?
- Is this their only survival mechanism?
- What scaffolding exists for transition?
2. Test institutional perception:
- Can institutions unilaterally change this?
- Do they understand downstream impacts?
- Is their "optional" view empirically accurate?
3. Decision tree:
IF truly unchangeable → Correct institutional view to MOUNTAIN
IF changeable + safe alternatives → Correct powerless view to ROPE
IF changeable + NO alternatives → ADD SCAFFOLD before any change
IF uncertainty → HALT changes until resolved
4. CRITICAL: Never proceed with changes until safety verified
