### 1. Rope: `ai_edu_decentralization`

*   **Claimed Type:** `rope`
*   **Structural Signature Analysis:** FALSE CI_ROPE signature for ai_edu_decentralization: Appears to be rope (explicit_rope_claim) but fails 1 Boltzmann structural test(s): [excess_above_floor(0.45)]. Coupling score=0.75. This constraint is "coordination-washed" — it hides extraction behind low metrics, distributed enforcement, or behavioral defaults.
*   **Orbit Signature:** `[rope, tangled_rope]`
*   **Perspectival Agreement:** Confirmed. All tested perspectives agree on the 'rope' classification.
*   **Suggested Resolution Strategy:**
    ```
1. Design measurement protocol for unknown
2. Collect data from N=30+ real-world instances
3. Calculate empirical metrics:
- suppression_requirement (enforcement needed)
- resistance_to_change (pushback level)
- base_extractiveness (asymmetric benefit flow)
4. Update constraint_metric/3 declarations with data
5. Re-run classification to resolve perspectival gap
    ```

### 9. Rope: `fair_use_doctrine`

*   **Claimed Type:** `rope`
*   **Structural Signature Analysis:** CONSTRUCTED LOW-EXTRACTION signature for fair_use_doctrine: Enforcement present (suppression=0.40, resistance=0.50) but extraction is low (0.10). This is a rule-based coordination structure, not an extraction mechanism.
*   **Orbit Signature:** `[rope]`
*   **Perspectival Agreement:** Confirmed. All tested perspectives agree on the 'rope' classification.
*   **Generated Omega:** Constraint fair_use_doctrine appears extractive (Snare) to individuals but unchangeable (Mountain) to institutions...
*   **Suggested Resolution Strategy:**
    ```
1. Test changeability:
- Can institutions modify fair_use_doctrine?
- What legal/political mechanisms exist?
- Historical precedents of change?
2. Test extraction:
- Is benefit flow symmetric or asymmetric?
- Who has veto power over changes?
3. Decision tree:
IF truly unchangeable + extractive → MANDATROPHY
IF changeable + extractive → Correct to SNARE
IF unchangeable + fair → Correct to MOUNTAIN
IF institutions falsely claim necessity → SNARE + fraud flag
    ```

### 10. Rope: `glp1_payload_efficiency_pivot`

*   **Claimed Type:** `rope`
*   **Structural Signature Analysis:** FALSE CI_ROPE signature for glp1_payload_efficiency_pivot: Appears to be rope (explicit_rope_claim) but fails 3 Boltzmann structural test(s): [scope_variant([rope,unknown]),excess_above_floor(0.3),nonsensical_coupling(0.3333333333333333)]. Coupling score=1.0. This constraint is "coordination-washed" — it hides extraction behind low metrics, distributed enforcement, or behavioral defaults.
*   **Orbit Signature:** `[scaffold, unknown]`
*   **Perspectival Agreement:** Confirmed. All tested perspectives agree on the 'rope' classification.
*   **Related Gap/Alert:** ! GAP: Institutional "Rope" appears as "Mountain" to Powerless.
*   **Generated Omega:** Constraint glp1_payload_efficiency_pivot appears unchangeable (Mountain) to individuals but optional (Rope) to institutions...
*   **Suggested Resolution Strategy:**
    ```
1. SAFETY ASSESSMENT (DO NOT SKIP):
- If institutions cut glp1_payload_efficiency_pivot, do individuals have alternatives?
- Is this their only survival mechanism?
- What scaffolding exists for transition?
2. Test institutional perception:
- Can institutions unilaterally change this?
- Do they understand downstream impacts?
- Is their "optional" view empirically accurate?
3. Decision tree:
IF truly unchangeable → Correct institutional view to MOUNTAIN
IF changeable + safe alternatives → Correct powerless view to ROPE
IF changeable + NO alternatives → ADD SCAFFOLD before any change
IF uncertainty → HALT changes until resolved
4. CRITICAL: Never proceed with changes until safety verified
