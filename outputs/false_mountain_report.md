3. Decision tree:
IF truly unchangeable → Correct institutional view to MOUNTAIN
IF changeable + safe alternatives → Correct powerless view to ROPE
IF changeable + NO alternatives → ADD SCAFFOLD before any change
IF uncertainty → HALT changes until resolved
4. CRITICAL: Never proceed with changes until safety verified

### 210. False Mountain: `unclos_2026`

*   **Severity:** `high`
*   **Gap Detected:** ! GAP: Institutional "Rope" appears as "Mountain" to Powerless.
*   **Perspectival Mismatch:**
    *   **Powerless View:** `mountain`
    *   **Institutional View:** `rope`
*   **Generated Omega:** omega_cut_safety_unclos_2026 (conceptual)
*   **Suggested Resolution Strategy:**
    ```
1. SAFETY ASSESSMENT (DO NOT SKIP):
- If institutions cut unclos_2026, do individuals have alternatives?
- Is this their only survival mechanism?
- What scaffolding exists for transition?
2. Test institutional perception:
- Can institutions unilaterally change this?
- Do they understand downstream impacts?
- Is their "optional" view empirically accurate?
3. Decision tree:
IF truly unchangeable → Correct institutional view to MOUNTAIN
IF changeable + safe alternatives → Correct powerless view to ROPE
IF changeable + NO alternatives → ADD SCAFFOLD before any change
IF uncertainty → HALT changes until resolved
4. CRITICAL: Never proceed with changes until safety verified
