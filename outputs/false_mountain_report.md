### 1. False Mountain: `26usc469_real_estate_exemption`

*   **Severity:** `critical`
*   **Gap Detected:** ! ALERT: Extractive "Snare" is masked as functional "Rope".
*   **Perspectival Mismatch:**
    *   **Powerless View:** `snare`
    *   **Institutional View:** `rope`
*   **Generated Omega:** omega_extraction_blindness_26usc469_real_estate_exemption (conceptual)
*   **Suggested Resolution Strategy:**
    ```
1. Interview affected individuals (N=10+):
- Who benefits from 26usc469_real_estate_exemption?
- Can you change/exit this constraint?
- What would happen if you tried?
2. Interview institutional actors (N=10+):
- What function does 26usc469_real_estate_exemption serve?
- Who would object to removing it?
- What alternatives exist?
3. Document benefit flows:
- Track who gains vs. who loses from status quo
- Measure asymmetric benefit distribution
4. Decision tree:
IF extraction confirmed → Reclassify as SNARE
IF functional & fair → Reclassify as ROPE
IF context-dependent → Add indexical resolution
    ```
