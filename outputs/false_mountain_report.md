### 566. False Mountain: `sadhu_integrity_protocol`

*   **Severity:** `high`
*   **Gap Detected:** ! GAP: Institutional "Rope" appears as "Mountain" to Powerless.
*   **Perspectival Mismatch:**
    *   **Powerless View:** `mountain`
    *   **Institutional View:** `rope`
*   **Generated Omega:** omega_cut_safety_sadhu_integrity_protocol (conceptual)
*   **Suggested Resolution Strategy:**
    ```
1. Design measurement protocol for unknown
2. Collect data from N=30+ real-world instances
3. Calculate empirical metrics:
- suppression_requirement (enforcement needed)
- resistance_to_change (pushback level)
- base_extractiveness (asymmetric benefit flow)
4. Update constraint_metric/3 declarations with data
5. Re-run classification to resolve perspectival gap
