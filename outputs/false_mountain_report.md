    ```
1. Design measurement protocol for unknown
2. Collect data from N=30+ real-world instances
3. Calculate empirical metrics:
- suppression_requirement (enforcement needed)
- resistance_to_change (pushback level)
- base_extractiveness (asymmetric benefit flow)
4. Update constraint_metric/3 declarations with data
5. Re-run classification to resolve perspectival gap
