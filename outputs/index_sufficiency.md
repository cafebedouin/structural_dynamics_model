# Index Sufficiency Test

## Executive Summary

**Verdict:** SUFFICIENT — Indices explain variance well. High perspectival rate confirms agent_power is working as designed.

### Collision Breakdown

| Category | Count | Rate |
|----------|------:|-----:|
| Classification failures (unknown/opaque) | 0 | 0.0% of collisions |
| Expected perspectival variance | 2 | 100.0% of collisions |
| Genuine collisions | 0 | 0.0% of constraints |
| **Total collisions** | **2** | across 1034 constraints |

- **Non-mountain anomaly rate:** 0.0% (0 of 906 non-mountain constraints)

## Expected Perspectival Variance

**2 collisions** are explained by agent_power perspective shifts — the framework working as designed.

| Transition | Count |
|------------|------:|
| snare ↔ tangled_rope | 1 |
| rope ↔ tangled_rope | 1 |

## All Collision Patterns

**Total collisions:** 2 across 2 constraints

### Most Common Type Transitions

| Transition | Frequency |
|------------|----------:|
| snare ↔ tangled_rope | 1 |
| rope ↔ tangled_rope | 1 |

### Collisions by Domain

| Domain | Collisions | Constraints Affected |
|--------|----------:|--------------------:|
| snare | 2 | 2 |

## Domain Sufficiency Analysis

How well do indices explain variance in each domain?

| Domain | Constraints | Avg Variance | Sufficiency |
|--------|----------:|-------------:|:-----------:|
| unknown_novel | 2 | 1.00 | High |
| piton | 91 | 0.98 | High |
| snare | 640 | 0.89 | High |
| scaffold | 21 | 0.82 | High |
| tangled_rope | 92 | 0.78 | High |
| rope | 60 | 0.69 | Medium |
| mountain | 128 | 0.40 | Medium |

**Note:** Higher variance = indices capture more differences (good)

## Stability Anomalies (Mountains Excluded)

Non-mountain constraints tested across 6+ index configs that always produce the same type.
These may indicate misclassification (mountains are excluded since they SHOULD be invariant).

*No non-mountain stability anomalies found.*

## Recommendations

1. **Perspectival health:** 100.0% of collisions are expected perspectival variance (agent_power driving type shifts). This confirms the index system is capturing real structural dynamics.
