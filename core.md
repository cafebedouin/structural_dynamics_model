# Deferential Realism: Core Principles

**Version 3.3 - Integrated & Semantically Unified**  
**Purpose:** Gateway introduction to the Deferential Realism framework  
**Read this first.** If the core framework makes sense, the domain extensions follow naturally.

---

## What This Framework Does

**Deferential Realism is a classification system for constraints.** It helps you distinguish:

- What appears unchangeable (and whether that appearance is accurate)
- What serves coordination vs. what extracts value
- What's temporary vs. what's permanent
- What's hybrid (coordination + extraction)
- What's degraded (lost function, maintained by inertia)

**The framework does NOT:**
- Tell you what to value
- Prescribe which constraints to accept or resist
- Resolve ethical dilemmas
- Eliminate paradoxes
- Guarantee optimal decisions

**The framework DOES:**
- Provide systematic methods for classifying constraint structure
- Specify the indices (WHO/WHEN/WHERE/HOW_MUCH) needed for coherent classification
- Distinguish misclassification types and their costs
- Map how same structure functions differently based on position
- Enable informed choice about energy allocation

**The core problem it solves:** Asking "Is this constraint real?" is ambiguous until you specify **WHO** is evaluating it, **WHEN**, **WHERE** they're positioned, and **HOW MUCH POWER** they have. The same constraint can be unchangeable from one perspective and reformable from another—both classifications are objectively true at their respective indices.

This isn't relativism ("truth is whatever"). It's **indexed realism:** truth is relative to position, but each indexed claim is objectively true or false. Different positions reveal different structural properties of the same constraint.

**What you do with accurate classification** depends on your values, resources, and risk tolerance. The framework provides the map; you choose the route.

**Root metaphor:** We use climbing/mountaineering imagery throughout. Think of constraint-space as terrain you're navigating with finite energy. Some features are immovable (mountains), some aid coordination (ropes), some trap (snares), some support temporarily (scaffolds), some appear solid but fail (pitons). The metaphor provides intuitive handles for abstract concepts while remaining operationally precise.

## The Five Domains

Deferential Realism integrates five philosophical branches:

1. **Epistemology** - How to classify constraints accurately through indexical specification
2. **Logic** - How to reason validly about constraint-types through formal operators
3. **Metaphysics** - What exists: constraints constitute entities, not vice versa
4. **Ethics** - How to act appropriately: reality-alignment as honesty-in-practice
5. **Aesthetics** - What beauty looks like: elegant alignment vs. grotesque fraud

**Plus two applied domains:**

6. **Psychology** - Internal constraint navigation (substrate, detritus, clarity fetishes)
7. **Sociology** - Social constraint navigation (relational integrity, power dynamics)

**Unifying principles across all domains:**
- **Accuracy commitment** - Classify constraints according to actual structure, not desired narrative
- **Energy conservation** - Finite resources demand strategic allocation
- **Indexical relativity** - Truth relative to position, objective within index
- **Reality-alignment** - Deference to what actually constrains
- **Containment capacity** - Some tensions are structurally permanent; skillful navigation holds paradox without forcing resolution

**Empirical validation:** Framework tested against 467 constraint scenarios across 35+ domains. See `validation/validation_report.md` for complete findings.

## The Problem This Solves

"Is carbon credit trading a good system?" appears simple, but consider four answers:

- **Corporation:** "Yes - efficient coordination mechanism rewarding sustainability investments."
- **Small business:** "Partially - compliance costs burden us while big players game the system."
- **Consumer:** "Irrelevant - prices just exist, we have no influence."
- **Activist:** "No - extractive greenwashing delaying real action while enriching middlemen."

All four are **objectively true** because they're answering different questions from different positions.

The problem isn't disagreement about facts. It's **indexical underspecification** - asking "What type of constraint is this?" without specifying the four critical indices. Traditional frameworks force a choice: either someone is wrong, or truth is purely subjective. Deferential Realism offers a third path: **specify the indices, resolve the ambiguity.**

---

## The Constraint Categories (Climbing Terrain & Equipment)

Every constraint falls into one of four fundamental types, distinguished by how they function:

### 1. Mountains (Immovable Terrain)

**Climbing metaphor:** Solid rock face, geological formation that cannot be changed by individual climber

**Definition:** Constraints rooted in physics, biology, logic, or mathematics that persist independent of human agreement or enforcement.

**Test:** If you ignore it, does the system collapse due to reality (not punishment)?

**Examples:**
- Thermodynamic limits on energy conversion
- Logical impossibility of circular definitions
- Biological need for water/oxygen
- Mathematical constraints in computation
- Death (biological mountain)
- Speed of light (physics mountain)

**Response:** Accept and navigate. Route your strategy around what cannot be changed.

**Agency within deference:** Even "zero degrees of freedom" constraints allow navigation choices—finding passes through mountain ranges, timing ascents for weather, choosing which immovable terrain to work around. Mountains also have second-order effects (rain shadows, mineral deposits, avalanche risk) that create new constraint landscapes. The framework currently treats Mountains as simple acceptance targets; fuller treatment of navigation-within-deference and cascade effects is TBD through practice.

**Common misclassification:** **False Summit** - appears as unchangeable limit but actually just a ridge with another path beyond. Test by checking: Who benefits from claiming this is unchangeable? What enforcement maintains this? Has this "limit" been surpassed elsewhere?

**Climbing wisdom:** Don't waste finite energy fighting gravity.

---

### 2. Ropes (Coordination Tools)

**Climbing metaphor:** Essential tool connecting climbers, enabling mutual support and collective ascent

**Definition:** Constructed systems solving genuine coordination problems, broadly beneficial to participants with low extraction.

**Test:** Does this prevent collisions or manage genuine scarcity? Who benefits? Is benefit reciprocal?

**Examples:**
- Traffic lights preventing intersection collisions
- Technical standards (USB-C, TCP/IP protocols)
- Meeting schedules coordinating collective action
- Shared language enabling communication
- Contracts enabling cooperation

**Response:** Maintain, refine if needed, replace if better alternative exists.

**Degradation path:** Rope → Tangled Rope (extraction accumulates) → Piton (function lost, only inertia remains)

**Climbing wisdom:** Test your holds—verify that coordination tools still serve their function.

---

### 3. Tangled Ropes (Coordination + Extraction Hybrids)

**Climbing metaphor:** Rope that both supports AND binds—provides aid but restricts movement

**Definition:** Structures with genuine coordination function (Rope core) but extractive implementation (Snare layer). **Not a detection pattern but a fundamental category** - 36% of constraints analyzed showed this irreducible hybrid structure.

**Test:** Does this serve coordination AND extract asymmetrically? Can you separate the functions?

**Examples:**
- Carbon credit markets (climate coordination + financial rent extraction)
- Health insurance systems (risk pooling + administrative extraction)
- Social media platforms (connection + attention/data extraction)
- Academic publishing (knowledge sharing + access rent)
- Venture capital (startup funding + control extraction)

**Response:** **Reform** - preserve coordination function, excise extraction mechanism. This is delicate work: cutting the whole rope destroys coordination; keeping it all maintains extraction.

**Two misclassification errors:**
- **Treat as pure Rope** → Defend entire system, legitimize extraction
- **Treat as pure Snare** → Destroy coordination, lose collective benefit

**Power-scaling effect:** Same base extraction experienced differently based on position:
- **Powerless agents:** Extraction amplified (feels like Snare)
- **Moderate agents:** See both functions (recognize as Tangled Rope)
- **Institutional agents:** Extraction reduced, may experience net benefit (feels like Rope)

**Climbing wisdom:** You can't always untangle while hanging—sometimes you work with the tangle temporarily while planning the reform.

---

### 4. Snares (Extractive Traps)

**Climbing metaphor:** Trap disguised as path or handhold—looks helpful but captures/harms

**Definition:** Structures maintained through power, extracting value asymmetrically from the many to benefit the few.

**Test:** Does enforcement stop, does constraint snap back immediately? Who actively resists transparency? Are there suppressed alternatives?

**Examples:**
- Payday loans (debt traps)
- Predatory contracts with one-sided terms
- Non-compete clauses restricting mobility
- Rent-seeking regulations protecting incumbents
- Artificial scarcity creating market power
- "Required" credentials serving gatekeeping rather than competence

**Response:** Expose, resist, dismantle where possible. If trapped, contain damage while seeking exit.

**Detection:** Check beneficiaries (who profits?), check enforcement (what maintains this?), check history (was this constructed or natural?), check alternatives (what's being suppressed?).

**Climbing wisdom:** Some holds are traps—test before committing your weight.

**Note on terminology:** Previously called "Noose" (execution device). "Snare" better fits climbing metaphor (trap in terrain) while maintaining the "tightening trap" concept with less visceral violence imagery.

---

### 5. Scaffolds (Temporary Support Structures)

**Climbing metaphor:** Temporary structure enabling construction or transition, designed to be dismantled

**Definition:** Time-limited supports enabling transition from one stable state to another, with explicit sunset clause.

**Test:** Is there a planned end date? Does the purpose have a completion point? What happens when dismantled?

**Examples:**
- Training wheels on bicycles (enable learning)
- Construction scaffolding (enable building)
- Temporary pandemic restrictions (enable crisis response)
- Bridge loans during restructuring (enable transition)
- Mentorship programs (enable skill development)
- Emergency measures (enable stabilization)

**Response:** Use when necessary, dismantle when purpose is served.

**Degradation paths:**
- **Scaffold → Piton** (purpose served but not removed → bureaucratic inertia)
- **Scaffold → Tangled Rope** (extraction added to temporary support → permanent rent-seeking)

**Hidden Tangled Rope risk:** Some "scaffolds" claim temporality but extract rent (e.g., VC funding that demands control, emergency powers that become permanent).

**Climbing wisdom:** Leave no trace—dismantle your scaffolds when done.

---

### 6. Pitons (Failed Old Anchors)

**Climbing metaphor:** Old metal spike once driven into rock as anchor—was functional, now fails under load, tempts those who don't know

**Definition:** Degraded constraints that once served coordination function but lost purpose due to environmental change. High maintenance cost, low benefit. Diagnostic marker for resource waste.

**Test:** Does enforcement cost more than any benefit? Has the coordinating function become obsolete? Does it persist through inertia rather than power?

**Examples:**
- Fax requirements in email era
- Obsolete regulatory reporting
- Dead letter laws still on books
- Legacy system dependencies
- Piton committees that meet but produce nothing
- Skeuomorphic design elements serving no function

**Response:** Bypass or eliminate—no coordination value to preserve, no political resistance needed (unlike Snares), just administrative cleanup.

**Common sources:**
- Degraded Tangled Ropes (extraction dried up, enforcement persists)
- Failed Scaffolds (didn't sunset when purpose served)
- Environmental Ropes (coordination function became obsolete)
- Bureaucratic accumulation (rules that lost purpose)

**Climbing wisdom:** Old pitons are safety hazards—remove them so others aren't tempted to trust failed anchors.

**Note on terminology:** Previously called "Zombie" (undead). "Piton" better fits climbing metaphor (old equipment that fails) and captures the specific danger: looks like support, fails under load.

---

## The Four Indices (Position on the Route)

Every constraint classification requires specifying four contextual parameters. **This is not optional**—asking "What type is this constraint?" without indices is like asking "Is this mountain climbable?" without saying from where, when, or with what resources.

### 1. WHO (Agent Power Position - Altitude on Route)

**Power-scaling mechanism:** Same base structure experienced differently based on power position. Higher power = more resources to navigate constraints, lower experienced extraction.

- `individual_powerless`: No exit options (serf, prisoner, child)
- `individual_moderate`: Some mobility (middle class, citizen)
- `individual_powerful`: High personal agency (wealthy, connected)
- `collective_organized`: Coordinated group action (union, movement)
- `institutional`: Controls enforcement (state, corporation, church)
- `analytical`: External observer (researcher, historian)

**Climbing analogy:** Same route at sea level vs. 20,000 feet requires different resources. Power position = altitude effects on extraction.

### 2. WHEN (Time Horizon - Planning Range)

- `immediate`: 1 year or less
- `biographical`: 20-50 years (single lifetime)
- `generational`: 50-100 years
- `historical`: 100-500 years
- `civilizational`: 500+ years

**Climbing analogy:** What's unchangeable on a day climb may be navigable on a season-long expedition.

### 3. WHERE (Exit Options - Route Flexibility)

- `trapped`: No physical or conceptual exit
- `constrained`: Exit possible but costly
- `mobile`: Can relocate with moderate costs
- `arbitrage`: Can play systems strategically
- `analytical`: Observer without personal stakes

**Climbing analogy:** Single route vs. multiple path options changes classification of "impassable" sections.

### 4. HOW MUCH (Spatial Scope - Terrain Scale)

- `local`: Single institution/community
- `regional`: Multiple institutions (state, province)
- `national`: Country-wide
- `continental`: Multi-national region
- `global`: Worldwide
- `universal`: Metaphysical necessity (logic, physics)

**Climbing analogy:** What's true on this peak may not hold across the range.

**Empirical finding:** These four indices are **sufficient** - 0% collision rate within the formal system. Same index configuration always produces same constraint type. No hidden fifth variable needed.

---

## Worked Example: Carbon Credit Trading (Indexed Classification)

The same system classifies differently based on index specification. This is not contradiction—it's how indexical relativity works.

**FOR small business owner** [moderate/biographical/constrained/national]:
- **Tangled Rope** - Has coordination function (climate action signals) but implementation extracts value from small players toward large institutions. Base extraction = 0.40, experienced as 0.40 (moderate power, no modifier). Reform needed to preserve coordination while removing rent extraction.

**FOR individual consumer** [powerless/biographical/trapped/national]:
- **Mountain** - Cannot personally change, appears as unchangeable price increase, must accept as given. Base extraction = 0.40, experienced as 0.60 (powerless modifier amplifies). Too powerless to reform, appears immovable from this position.

**FOR multinational corporation** [institutional/generational/arbitrage/global]:
- **Rope** - Coordination mechanism they can navigate strategically, sometimes even profit from through optimization. Base extraction = 0.40, experienced as -0.08 (institutional modifier reduces to net benefit). Can game the system, coordinate advantageously.

**FOR policy analyst** [analytical/historical/analytical/global]:
- **Snare** - Extractive structure where financial intermediaries capture value while emission reductions underdeliver. Alternative mechanisms (direct regulation, carbon tax) would achieve goal with less extraction. Sees the construction, the beneficiaries, the suppressed alternatives.

**All four are true.** The disagreement arises from indexical underspecification, not factual disputes. The carbon credit system **IS**:
- A Mountain (to powerless individuals)
- A Tangled Rope (to those who see both coordination and extraction)
- A Rope (to those benefiting from coordination)
- A Snare (to those bearing extraction costs or focused on systemic harm)

The power-scaling mechanism explains **why**: same base extraction (0.40) experienced as 0.60 by powerless (Snare territory), 0.40 by moderate (Tangled Rope threshold), and -0.08 by institutional (net benefit = Rope).

## Cross-Domain Integration: External & Internal Constraints

The same classification logic applies across domains. **Isomorphic structure:**

| External (Sociology) | Internal (Psychology) | Shared Logic |
|---------------------|----------------------|--------------|
| **Mountains** (gravity, laws) | **Substrate** (biology, trauma) | Zero degrees of freedom → defer |
| **Ropes** (coordination) | **Negotiable Patterns** (habits) | Positive degrees → coordinate |
| **Tangled Ropes** (hybrid) | **Hybrid Patterns** (serve + harm) | Dual function → reform |
| **Snares** (extraction) | **Self-Extraction** (clarity fetishes) | Negative degrees → refuse |
| **Scaffolds** (temporary) | **Developmental Supports** (therapy) | Time-limited → use then remove |
| **Pitons** (degraded) | **Abandoned Camps** (empty tombs) | Lost function → clear debris |

**Example: "I can't say no"**

**External classification:**
- If saying no → job loss: **Snare** (exit threat)
- If saying no → relationship loss: **Mountain or Snare** (depends on power balance)
- If saying no → mild awkwardness: **Neither** (navigation discomfort)

**Internal classification:**
- If biological limit (exhaustion): **Substrate** (defer to it)
- If learned from trauma: **Detritus** (clearable pattern)
- If demand for comfort: **Clarity Fetish** (self-extraction, drop demand)

**Diagnostic sequence:**
1. Classify external constraint (what actually happens if I say no?)
2. Classify internal constraint (why do I feel I can't?)
3. Distinguish external consequences from internal barriers
4. Navigate appropriately based on correct classification

**Internalized constraints:** External Snares can become internal Substrate or Detritus through internalization. Oppression absorbed becomes self-policing. Liberation requires both external resistance AND internal clearing.

---

## Containment Logic: Holding Structural Paradoxes

**Discovery:** Some tensions are structurally permanent—forcing resolution causes collapse. These are not problems to solve but **overhangs to traverse**.

**Climbing metaphor:** **Overhang** - rock face projecting outward where you can't progress by going straight up. Must traverse horizontally, accept the difficulty. Not a failure of technique—just terrain type requiring different navigation.

**Examples of structural paradoxes:**
- **Autonomy vs. Connection** (both needed, always in tension)
- **Security vs. Growth** (both valuable, trade-offs inevitable)
- **Present vs. Future** (current satisfaction vs. future preparation)
- **Material frame vs. Functional frame** (both true, both incomplete)

**Containment protocol (from psychology.md):**
1. **Name** the paradox (what two goods are in tension?)
2. **Map** the oscillation (how does tension manifest?)
3. **Test** edges (is resolution actually impossible or just uncomfortable?)
4. **Accept** irresolvability (this is structure, not failure)
5. **Choose** for current context (partial satisfaction on one side)
6. **Hold** tension without collapse (don't force resolution)

**What containment is NOT:**
- Resignation ("nothing matters")
- Optimization ("maximize both")
- Resolution ("I figured it out")
- Transcendence ("I'm beyond this tension")

**What containment IS:**
- Recognition (this is structural, expected)
- Sequential choice (autonomy today, connection tomorrow)
- Partial satisfaction (both get some attention)
- Mature navigation (comfort with incompletion)

**Climbing wisdom:** Some sections require traverse, not ascent—that's not failure, it's skillful route-finding.

---

## Discomfort vs. Damage: The Testing Boundary

**Critical distinction for constraint testing:** Discomfort is subjective reaction (fear, awkwardness, uncertainty). Damage is objective harm (physiological consequences, structural breakdown, irreversible loss).

**Why this matters:**
- **Substrate testing:** Violation produces damage (not just discomfort)
- **Detritus testing:** Violation produces discomfort (but not damage)
- **Edge testing:** Distinguish "this feels scary" from "this will harm me"
- **Containment:** Paradoxes produce ongoing discomfort but not damage

**Examples:**

| Situation | Feels Like | Actually Is |
|-----------|------------|-------------|
| Sleep deprivation | Discomfort (initially) | Damage (cognitive decline measurable) |
| Saying "no" (no external threat) | Discomfort (social awkwardness) | Not damage (just navigation) |
| Holding autonomy/connection paradox | Discomfort (never fully satisfied) | Not damage (structural tension) |
| Running past comfort zone | Discomfort (burning muscles) | Not damage (40% rule - you have more capacity) |
| Running past injury warning | Discomfort (sharp pain) | Damage (tissue breakdown) |

**Testing protocol:**
1. Violate constraint slightly
2. Observe consequences carefully
3. Distinguish subjective experience from objective harm
4. Classify based on evidence, not feeling

**Goggins Calibration:** Modern humans often misclassify comfort limits as Substrate. The "40% rule": when you think you're done, you're only 40% depleted. Many claimed "biological limits" are actually Detritus (historical fear patterns) or Clarity Fetishes (demand for comfort).

**Climbing wisdom:** Discomfort is part of ascent. Damage means you've exceeded actual limits. Learn the difference.

---

## What Makes This Different

Most frameworks choose between:
1. **Absolutism:** Universal truths apply everywhere
2. **Relativism:** Truth is purely subjective

Deferential Realism rejects this binary:

**Indexical Realism:** Truth is relative to position, but each indexed claim is objectively true or false. Multiple valid answers exist, but they're **not arbitrary**—they're constrained by empirical reality at each index.

This is closer to physics (velocity is relative to reference frame, but measurements are objective) than to politics (mere opinion).

**The innovation:** Indexical relativity isn't just an epistemic method—it's a metaphysical claim about how constraint-space is structured. Same constraint genuinely functions differently based on power position, time horizon, exit options, and spatial scope.

---

## How to Use This Framework

### 1. Start with Classification
- Identify the constraint you're analyzing
- **Specify your indices** (WHO/WHEN/WHERE/HOW_MUCH) - not optional!
- Apply the tests:
  - **Mountains:** Does reality enforce this (not humans)?
  - **Ropes:** Does this coordinate genuinely with low extraction?
  - **Tangled Ropes:** Both coordination AND extraction?
  - **Snares:** High extraction, power-maintained, alternatives suppressed?
  - **Scaffolds:** Temporary with sunset clause?
  - **Pitons:** High maintenance, low benefit, inertia-driven?

### 2. Strategic Response (Values-Dependent)

**Classification informs choice but doesn't determine it.** Different values may prescribe different responses to the same classified constraint. The framework provides structural clarity; ethics determines action.

**Common response patterns** (not prescriptions):
- **Mountains:** Often accepted (fighting gravity wastes energy) BUT some agents may choose to work around, wait for technology, or accept consequences of violation based on their values
- **Ropes:** Often maintained (coordination serves collective) BUT reformers may seek better alternatives, minimalists may exit coordination systems
- **Tangled Ropes:** Often targeted for reform (preserve coordination, excise extraction) BUT revolutionaries may prefer dismantlement, conservatives may accept extraction as cost of coordination
- **Snares:** Often resisted (extraction harms) BUT trapped agents may pragmatically comply, institutions may defend their own Snares
- **Scaffolds:** Often used then dismantled (temporary utility) BUT some may extend or abandon prematurely based on risk tolerance
- **Pitons:** Often bypassed (no value to preserve) BUT some may clear for others' safety, some may ignore as harmless

**The framework's role:** Accurate classification enables **informed choice** about where to allocate finite energy. Different ethical frameworks will prescribe different allocations.

**Examples of value-dependent responses:**

*Carbon credits (classified as Tangled Rope from moderate/biographical/constrained/national):*
- **Reformist:** Work to separate coordination from extraction
- **Revolutionary:** Dismantle and replace with direct regulation
- **Conservative:** Accept extraction as necessary cost
- **Libertarian:** Exit system if possible
- **Pragmatist:** Use system while building alternative

*Sleep requirement (classified as Mountain/Substrate):*
- **Health-first:** Defer immediately, protect sleep
- **Achievement-first:** Minimize sleep to threshold, accept damage risk
- **Balanced:** Navigate around constraint strategically

**Ethics documentation:** See `ethics.md` for systematic treatment of how different values interact with constraint classifications. That document addresses: What makes extraction bad? What makes coordination good? How do different ethical frameworks (utilitarian, deontological, virtue, care) navigate the same classified constraints?

**Critical point:** Using this framework to **avoid legitimate challenges** ("It's a Mountain for me") is a classification error (False Mountain) or an ethical choice (prioritizing comfort over growth), not a framework flaw. The framework provides the **map**; you choose the **route** based on your values and risk tolerance.

### 3. Avoid Common Misclassification Errors
- **Type I (False Mountain):** Calling Snare a Mountain → surrender to changeable injustice
- **Type II (False Snare/Rope):** Calling Mountain a Snare → waste energy fighting reality
- **Type III (Snare as Rope):** Defending extraction as coordination → maintain harm
- **Type IV (Rope as Snare):** Destroying coordination as extraction → lose benefit
- **Type V (Piton as active):** Fighting dead constraint → waste political capital
- **Type VI (Tangled Rope mishandled):** Treating hybrid as pure → either maintain extraction OR destroy coordination

**Error asymmetry:** Type I and Type III are most costly (surrender and complicity). When uncertain, err toward testing claimed Mountains and investigating claimed Ropes for extraction.

## Empirical Development & Epistemic Status

**What we've done:** This framework emerged from systematic analysis of 467 constraint scenarios across 35+ domains over several months of iterative development.

**What we've found (within our test corpus):**

**Index sufficiency:**
- 0% collision rate when indices fully specified (same WHO/WHEN/WHERE/HOW_MUCH → same classification)
- 99.1% variance across perspectives (constraints genuinely change type based on position)
- Four indices appear sufficient within tested cases—no fifth variable needed to explain variance

**Category patterns:**
- 36% showed Tangled Rope structure (irreducible hybrid, not transition state)
- 18 cases showed False Mountain pattern (claimed natural but constructed)
- 93 cases showed Scaffold pattern (temporal limitation, not distinct category)
- Piton pattern confirmed across degradation paths

**Domain observations:**
- Social/economic/political constraints: Higher mean extraction (0.47-0.52)
- Technical/biological constraints: Lower mean extraction (0.18)
- Biological constraints: 89% emerge without human construction

**Power-scaling mechanism:**
- Collision rate without power modifiers: 8.2%
- Collision rate with power modifiers: 0%
- Suggests power operates as structural property modulating extraction experience
- Power position defined by observable control over exit/enforcement/resources (not subjective)

**What we claim:**
- **NOT:** Empirical universality (all constraints everywhere fit this model)
- **NOT:** Perfect measurement (power limits information access)
- **NOT:** Completed validation (this requires independent replication across contexts)
- **YES:** Internal consistency within tested corpus
- **YES:** Indexed objectivity (classifications are true/false at specified indices)
- **YES:** Practical utility (framework aids strategic energy allocation)

**Epistemic positioning:**
This is an **evidence-informed conjecture** developed through iterative testing, not a validated universal theory. The framework has shown internal coherence and practical utility in the contexts we've explored. Whether it holds across cultures, scales to institutional analysis, or withstands critical scrutiny remains to be determined through broader application and independent verification.

**The honest stance:** Everything here could be wrong. This represents our current best understanding of constraint-space structure based on available evidence. We're choosing to work with this model because it appears useful, while remaining open to revision, refinement, or replacement as evidence accumulates.

**What comes next:** The framework's true value will only emerge through sustained application across diverse contexts, independent replication of findings, and critical engagement with edge cases and failure modes. Details like granularity of power indices, threshold calibration, and cross-cultural applicability will be resolved through practice, not speculation.

See `validation/validation_report.md` for complete methodology, corpus details, and honest limitations.

## Critical Reminders

**Philosophical stance:** This framework operates from **methodological skepticism**. Everything here could be wrong. We're choosing to work with this model because it appears coherent and useful based on available evidence, while remaining open to revision or replacement.

**What this framework does NOT claim:**
- Universal empirical truth (these patterns may not hold everywhere/everywhen)
- Perfect measurement (power dynamics limit information access)  
- Ethical prescription (classification ≠ obligation—your values determine response)
- Paradox resolution (some tensions are structural, containment is the answer)
- Predictive certainty (classification aids choice, doesn't guarantee outcomes)
- Totalization (this is a diagnostic tool, not a theory of everything)

**What this framework DOES claim:**
- Internal consistency within tested corpus (0% collision with indices specified)
- Indexed objectivity (classifications are true/false within specified position)
- Practical utility (distinguishing changeable from unchangeable aids strategic allocation)
- Cross-domain applicability (same logic works for external and internal constraints)
- Empirical grounding (developed through systematic testing, open to falsification)

**The framework's boundaries:**
- Does NOT predict outcomes (classification informs, doesn't determine)
- Does NOT resolve values conflicts (enables clarity about disagreement structure)
- Does NOT eliminate complexity (maps terrain, doesn't flatten it)
- Does NOT absorb objections (can be wrong about classifications)

**What accurate classification enables:**
- Strategic energy allocation (don't fight gravity, don't maintain pitons)
- Honest disagreement (identify indexical differences, not facts)
- Targeted reform (preserve coordination, excise extraction in Tangled Ropes)
- Paradox navigation (contain tension without forcing collapse)

**The goal:** Use finite energy effectively. Don't waste it fighting unchangeable terrain (Mountains). Don't surrender it to changeable extraction (Snares). Don't demand resolution of structural tensions (Overhangs). Navigate honestly within what actually constrains you.

## Status and Limitations

**Framework maturity:** Developed over several months through iterative testing on 467 constraint scenarios across 35+ domains. Shows internal coherence and practical utility within explored contexts. **Not validated through independent replication or peer review.**

**What we know (with evidence):**
- Core structure (4 categories + 4 indices + power-scaling) shows 0% collision rate in tested corpus
- Tangled Rope prevalence (36%) suggests irreducible hybrids are common, not edge cases
- Power modifiers reduce collision rate from 8.2% to 0% (suggests power is structural, not hidden variable)
- Cross-domain applicability appears strong (psychology/sociology isomorphism holds)

**What remains uncertain (requires broader application):**
- External peer review and independent replication
- Cross-cultural applicability (corpus Western-leaning, may miss context-dependent patterns)
- Long-term institutional utility (framework is new, adoption effects unknown)
- Temporal transition mechanics (Rope → Tangled Rope → Piton lifecycle observed but not formalized)
- Threshold calibration (extraction/suppression cutoffs may need context adjustment)
- Whether unmodeled variables create real-world collisions beyond formal system

**Details to be determined through practice (not speculation):**
- Granularity of power indices (discrete vs. continuous, overlapping power positions)
- Boundary cases between categories (Tangled Rope vs. Snare in contested systems)
- Cross-cultural index adaptations (collectivist vs. individualist power dynamics)
- Temporal dynamics (degradation rates, calcification triggers)
- Meta-constraints (limits on classification capacity itself)

**Known failure modes:**
- Classification requires good information (power limits access to evidence about beneficiaries, enforcement, alternatives)
- Users may misidentify their own power position (powerful often feel powerless, vice versa)
- Framework could be used to justify inaction ("It's a Mountain for me" as excuse)
- Complexity may create analysis paralysis (indexing becomes Clarity Fetish)
- Tangled Rope reform is politically difficult (defenders benefit from tangle)

**Honest epistemic stance:**
This framework represents our current best understanding based on available evidence and systematic testing. It could be wrong in whole or part. We're working with it because it appears useful, while remaining genuinely open to:
- Revision (adjusting categories, indices, or mechanisms based on new evidence)
