## Indexical Relativity: The Missing Parameter

Classifications are relative to WHO, WHEN, WHERE, and HOW MUCH POWER.

**Mountains are agent-relative:**
- What's Mountain for powerless individual might be Rope for institution
- What's Mountain in single lifetime might be Rope across centuries

**This is not relativism:**
- Each indexed classification is objectively true/false
- Structure of constraint is real
- But *how it functions* depends on agent's position

**Example: Medieval Church**
- FOR serf: Mountain (unchangeable, must accept)
- FOR historian: Snare (extractive, eventually collapsed)
- FOR Pope: Rope (coordination mechanism maintained by choice)

All three are TRUE. Different indices, different answers.
